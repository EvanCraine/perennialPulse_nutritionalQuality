		"abstract": "Diversification of plant-based food sources is necessary to improve global food and nutritional security. Pulses have enormous nutritional and health benefits in preventing malnutrition and chronic diseases while contributing positively to reducing environmental footprint. Pulses are rich in diverse nutritional and non-nutritional constituents which can be classified as bioactive compounds due to their biological effect. These bioactive compounds include but are not limited to proteins, dietary fibres, resistant starch, polyphenols, saponins, lectins, phytic acids, and enzyme inhibitors. While these compounds are of importance in ensuring food and nutritional security, some of the bioactive constituents have ambivalent properties. These properties include having antioxidant, anti-hypertensive and prebiotic effects. Others have a deleterious effect of decreasing the digestibility and/or bioavailability of essential nutrients and are therefore termed antinutritional factors/compounds. Various processing techniques exist to reduce the content of antinutritional factors found in pulses. Traditional processing of pulses comprises soaking, dehulling, milling, germination, fermentation, and boiling, while examples of emerging processing techniques include microwaving, extrusion, and micronization. These processing techniques can be tailored to purpose and pulse type to achieve desired results. Herein, the nutritional qualities and properties of bioactive compounds found in pulses in meeting the sustainable development goals are presented. It also discusses the effect of processing techniques on the nutritional and non-nutritional constituents in pulses as well as the health and environmental benefits of pulse-diet consumption. Major challenges linked to pulses that could limit their potential of being ideal crops in meeting the sustainable development goal 2 agenda are highlighted.",

However, several anti-nutritional compounds, such as trypsin inhibitor, phenolic compounds, phytates, cyanogenic compounds, lectins and saponins are also found in the legumes. Most of the anti-nutritional compounds of the pulses are present in the seed coat. Most of these compounds are sensitive to heat and can be substantially reduced by milling, cooking, germination, fermentation and heat processing. This review paper summarizes anti-nutritional compounds present in different pulses including their fractions, significance and beneficial and adverse effect on human health. The aim of this paper is to enlighten the readers about the anti-nutritional compounds present in the pulses and possible processing methods to enhance utilization of pulses.",

		"abstract": "The effects of domestic cooking on the content of amino acids and antinutrients of Phaseolus angularis, Phaseolus calcaratus and Dolichos lablab seeds were evaluated. Heat treatment (30 min) caused significant declines (P<0·05) in the apparent recovery of most of the essential amino acids except leucine and phenylalanine for P angularis, and except phenylalanine for P calcaratus. Cooking D lablab seeds (60 min) also resulted in a significant reduction (P<0·05) in the apparent recovery of all the essential amino acids except leucine, histidine, lysine and threonine. Increased cooking time for P angularis (60 min), P calcaratus (60 min) and D lablab (120 min) led to a lower apparent recovery of methionine (28·9–31·6%) and cystine (17·1–19·3%). Even with increased cooking times, the total essential amino acid levels in all three cooked seeds remained higher than that of the FAO/WHO requirement, except for methionine and cystine. Cooking (60 min) was found to be effective in reducing the tannin contents of P angularis, P calcaratus and D lablab seeds by 70·6, 64·6 and 74·6%, respectively. Upon cooking, phytate and trypsin inhibitory activity in different seeds were also reduced to different extents depending on the cooking times. ©1997 SCI",

		"abstract": "Grain legumes, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), lupins (Lupinus spp.), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), represent one of the most quality and least expensive solutions for a long-term demand for plant protein in animal husbandry. One of the limitations to an increased use of grain legumes as feed is the presence of diverse compounds in their grain, commonly referred to as anti-nutritional factors, that both decrease nutritive value of grain legumes and, if taken in larger amounts, cause health problems that may be fatal for both human and the animals. By this reason, breeding programmes of all grain legumes is aimed at decreasing the content of anti-nutritional factors to a safe extent. Breeding of soybean cultivars for reduced amount of antinutritive factors resulted in the development of Kunitz-free soybean cultivars, which are suitable for thermal processing at lower temperatures and during a shorter period of time. This is the way of saving energy and preserving valuable nutritional composition of soybean grain. As for other species, the most significant progress has been made in protein pea, where all modern cultivars have either low or very low content of various antinutritional factors. Among the improvements are also 'zero-tannin' cultivars in faba bean, with a wide utilization in both animal feeding and bread industry, lowtoxin common vetch cultivars, 'sweet' cultivars in lupins and low-ODAP cultivars in grass pea.",

		"abstract": "Condensed tannins are major flavonoid end products that affect the nutritional quality of many legume seeds. They chelate minerals and interact with proteins, thus reducing their bioavailability. Tannins also contribute to seed coat color and pigment distribution or intensity. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed tannin concentration in common bean and Mendelian genes for seed coat color and pattern. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines, derived from crosses between the Andean and Mesoamerican genepools were used for QTL identification and for mapping STS markers associated with seed color loci. Seed coat condensed tannins were determined with a butanol–HCl method and a total of 12 QTL were identified on separate linkage groups (LGs) in each of the populations with individual QTL explaining from 10 to 64% of the phenotypic variation for this trait. Loci on linkage groups B3 and B10 were associated with the Mendelian genes Z and Bip for partly colored seed coat pattern, while a QTL on linkage group B7 was associated with the P gene which is the primary locus for the control of color expression in beans. In conclusion, this study found that the inheritance of tannin concentration fits an oligogenic model and identifies novel putative alleles at seed coat color and pattern genes that control tannin accumulation. The results will be important for the genetic improvement of nutritionally enhanced or biofortified beans that have health promoting effects from higher polyphenolics or better iron bioavailability.",

Significant (P<0.05) variations existed among the legumes with respect to their proximate composition, mineral constituent and amino acid profile. Lentil was found to be a good source of protein, while cowpea was good in ash among the grain legumes tested. All four types of legumes were also better suppliers of mineral matter, particularly potassium, phosphorus, calcium, copper, iron, and zinc. However, the concentrations of various mineral constituents was not in good nutritional balance. It was concluded that the four legumes tested were rich in lysine, leucine and arginine and can fulfil the essential amino acid requirement of human diet except for S-containing amino acids and tryptophan. In order to make good, the deficiency of certain essential amino acids in legume protein, they must be supplemented with other vegetables, meat and dairy products (e.g., Whey, yogurt).",

		"abstract": "A comprehensive study to assess and compare physico-chemical, nutritional and functional properties of a chickpea germplasm collection was carried out. The collection, composed of 57 accessions, also included black chickpeas from Apulia (Southern Italy), previously shown to display peculiar phenotypic and genetic features with respect to desi and kabuli chickpeas, and for which no information is currently available. Associations of genetic and phenotypic traits with nutritional and functional properties were assessed. Black (including Apulian types) and brown chickpeas showed a dietary fiber content ranging from 18.0 to 22.1 g 100 g−1, high bioactive compound contents, and levels of PUFA that reached 64.4 and 67.0 g 100 g−1 of total fatty acids, respectively. Brown accessions were characterized by high values of water absorption capacity (1.9 g water g−1 of flour), therefore could be suitable for mixing with cereal flours to produce cereal-pulse foods. Our findings highlight the nutritional and technological potential of local landraces which are being replaced by modern cultivars and are therefore, at risk of genetic erosion.",

		"abstract": "More than half of the world populations are affected by micronutrient malnutrition and one third of world’s population suffers from anemia and zinc deficiency, particularly in developing countries. Iron and zinc deficiencies are the major health problems worldwide. Phytic acid is the major storage form of phosphorous in cereals, legumes, oil seeds and nuts. Phytic acid is known as a food inhibitor which chelates micronutrient and prevents it to be bioavailabe for monogastric animals, including humans, because they lack enzyme phytase in their digestive tract. Several methods have been developed to reduce the phytic acid content in food and improve the nutritional value of cereal which becomes poor due to such antinutrient. These include genetic improvement as well as several pre-treatment methods such as fermentation, soaking, germination and enzymatic treatment of grains with phytase enzyme. Biofortification of staple crops using modern biotechnological techniques can potentially help in alleviating malnutrition in developing countries.",

		"abstract": "Pollinators contribute widely to the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Due to habitat loss, reduced food availability, increased parasite and pathogen pressure, and increased exposure to environmental toxins, these insects are facing steeply declining populations, which is causing global alarm. While a single approach to solving the pollinator crisis is unrealistic, canola grown in the inland Pacific Northwest region of the United States could have a major positive effect on wild bee populations. This region is exceptionally well suited for canola production, and canola provides extensive pollen and nectar food resources to bees. Canola production in the inland Pacific Northwest could aid bees—this region is dominated by cereal crops, which provide no food resources. At the same time, insect pollination from both wild bees and managed honey bees may increase canola seed yields, creating an economic boost for farmers. The aim of this article is to inform growers of the importance of pollinators in the canola growing region of the Inland Pacific Northwest and to provide crop management recommendations to facilitate habitat and food conservation for these pollinators.",

		"abstract": "Most Papilionoideae species exhibit specialized flowers with the standard petal placed in the upper position and the keel and surrounding wings acting as the landing platform for bee visitors. For some groups, however, flowers became resupinate so that bees land at the standard petal. In this upside-down morphology, the pollen is deposited onto the dorsal side of visitors, instead of the ventral side as in most keel flowers. To understand how these inverted keel flowers work and their differences from normal keel flowers, we studied the resupinate species Canavalia brasiliensis, Centrosema pascuorum and Clitoria fairchildiana, and compared with the normal keel Lathyrus pubescens, Crotalaria micans and Dioclea violacea. Both the behavior and morphology of bee visitors were observed and compared to the flower morphology. We observed that most features of the mechanism exhibited by inverted keel flower are found at keel flowers, except for three key innovations: a thickening at wings’ margin in contact with the visitors’ body, tighter interlocking between petals and strengthening of the vexillum structure. Most visitors are adapted to flower characteristics in their morphology and behavior, although some act as thieves due to some of their morphological features, such as mouthpart length. In spite of their differences, bees behave almost in the same way when visiting both normal and inverted keel morphologies. Compared to keel flowers, inverted keel flowers evolved toward more restrictive structures that require large-bodied bees to operate them. Finally, we discuss possible selective pressures that might have led to the evolution of inverted keel flowers.",

Mean concentrations of RFO, sugar alcohols, FOS and RS were 4071 mg, 1423 mg, 62 mg, and 7.5 g 100 g−1 dry matter, respectively. Signiﬁcant variations were observed in lentil prebiotic carbohydrate concentrations: RFO concentrations varied with variety, RS varied with location, and sorbitol and mannitol each varied with both variety and location. These results show that lentils contain nutritionally signiﬁcant amounts of prebiotic carbohydrates and, that it may be possible to enhance those amounts through breeding and locational sourcing.",

		"abstract": "Early growth is a critical phase of the crop cycle, which lasts from emergence to the beginning of competition between plants and is sensitive to sowing conditions and species characteristics. Providing tools to improve the management of this critical phase in intercrops is a challenge for agroecology as these cropping systems are the subject of renewed interest for their ability to maintain yields while requiring fewer inputs. The aim of the present study was to investigate variations in early growth under different sowing conditions in different species with contrasted seed and seedling characteristics (seed mass, hypogeal or epigeal emergence, and legume and non-legume species), especially species used as intercrops. Experiments were carried out in glasshouses using different sowing depths and levels of mineral nutrition, first for each species separately, then in mixed sowings. In the first set of experiments, biomass at emergence and relative growth rate after emergence were measured and then modelled as a function of seed mass, mineral nutrition, and time to emergence. Predictive equations were tested by comparing simulations with biomass measured in the second set of experiments, for two intercrops grown under varied sowing conditions. Finally, simulations were run to analyse variations in the early growth of two intercrops (durum wheat/pea or alfalfa) under a wider range of sowing conditions (seed mass, sowing depth, and with or without mineral nutrition). Biomass at emergence was positively correlated with seed mass, and in epigeal species, was also negatively impacted by time to emergence. Relative growth rate was highly stimulated by mineral nutrition whereas its response to time to emergence varied among species. The amount of seminal reserves at emergence (in hypogeal species) and the cotyledon specific mass (in epigeal species) were correlated with the establishment of the relative growth rate. When evaluated, the model was shown to satisfactorily predict the early growth of two intercrops. Used as a simulation tool, the model indicated that all the sowing techniques tested can have a major influence on total biomass and on the proportion of each component species when competition begins. This model can thus contribute to the management of sowing techniques for sole as well as combined crops whose effects are difficult to predict and are also difficult to analyse from field experiments alone because of the number of possible combinations and interactions.",

		"abstract": "This study describes and analyses how seed placement and seed weight influence the response of emergence and early growth of carrot seedlings to changes in seedbed conditions (temperature and surface structure). The first experiment was carried out in a glasshouse with different sowing conditions (1, 3 and 5 cm sowing depths, 2 and 5 mm wet or dry crusts) and two seed weight ranges. The final emergence percentages (40–94%) and times from 50% germination to 50% emergence (55–105°Cd) varied widely. Seed weights had a marked influence only in the most extreme conditions. Seedling growth was then analysed in growth chambers at two temperatures (10 and 20°C), for the same two seed weight ranges and different times of growth in the dark. Hypocotyl elongation rates and growth forces decreased when this time increased. Heavy seeds had longer final hypocotyl lengths and greater growth forces, which explained their better emergence from deep sowing and with surface obstacles. Growth after emergence both in the glasshouse and growth chamber was influenced by seed weight and time from germination to emergence: the seedling weight at emergence depended only on initial seed weight; the seedling relative growth rate was not influenced by the initial seed weight, but decreased with increase in time before emergence. This was due to a decrease in cotyledon photosynthetic efficiency. Poor seedbed structure and seed placement control affect not only emergence but also early growth. These results provide basic information for modelling the emergence and early growth of dicotyledon epigeal seedlings.",

		"abstract": "Traits that enable plants to exploit low-resource environments (e.g., slow tissue turnover, low transpiration rate, high root: shoot ratio, and high concentrations of plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores) are physiologically linked to key growth-related traits (low rates of photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and growth). Similar suites of traits occur as both phenotypically plastic and evolutionary responses to stress. We suggest that a genetic change in a switch or underlying trait that turns on this stress resistance syndrome (SRS), which causes it to be expressed over a wider range of environmental circumstances, would effectively convert a high-resource genotype into one that is more stress-tolerant. Because of physiological linkages between growth-related traits and the SRS, any heritable change in a key growth-related trait will pleiotropically affect the SRS. Therefore, heritable changes in these key growth-related traits could be accompanied by evolution of the entire SRS. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from single-gene mutants that differ in many stress-related traits, rapid evolution of metaltolerant populations that are broadly stress-resistant, and consistent patterns of traits in species along gradients in resource availability. Similar evolutionary patterns occur in many animal taxa, which suggests that it is a general evolutionary phenomenon. We suggest that rapid evolution in response to changing environmental stress may allow many short-lived species to respond to human-induced environmental change and provide opportunities to develop stress-resistant crops. However, the time lag between generations of long-lived species that dominate most natural vegetation may not allow mature individuals of these species to keep pace with rapid global change",

		"abstract": "Grain legumes occupy an important place in human nutrition, especially in the dietary pattern of low-income groups of people in developing countries. Legumes, considered as poor man's meat, are generally good sources of slow release carbohydrates and are rich in proteins. Legumes are normally consumed after processing, which not only improves palatability of foods but also increases the bioavailability of nutrients, by inactivating trypsin and growth inhibitors and haemagglutinins. Starch, the major biopolymeric constituent of legumes, upon processing gets partially modified into resistant starch (RS). The latter, a man made functional dietary fibre, is a unique ingredient that can yield high quality foods, in addition to its significance on faecal bulk and butyrate production, which are the putative markers of colonic health of humans. The slow and reduced digestibility of legume starch has been attributed to its amylose, which is considerably branched and is of high molecular weight. Dietary fibre, which is a heterogeneous mixture of several types of polysaccharides, is rich in legumes, especially in their husk fractions and contributes to beneficial therapeutic health effects.",

		"abstract": "Legume forage is the most economical source of nutrients for ruminants. Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) is high nutritive forage growing worldwide and possesses polyphenolics including condensed tannins (CT) that contribute to some of its superior nutritional properties such as improved protein utilization, bloat-free, and anthelmintic characteristics. This review attempts to capture the latest research in characterizing the impact of polyphenolics on the feeding value of sainfoin with an emphasis on CT. Sainfoin contains a diverse array of polyphenolics and its CT content declines as the plant matures, with an increase in the degree of polymerization and a decreasing proportion of prodelphinidins, resulting in a reduction in biological activity. This forage is best to be utilized between bud to flowering stage to balance the biological activity of CT and biomass yield. Incorporation of sainfoin into alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pasture has been effective in reducing alfalfa pasture bloat due to the presence of CT. New sainfoin populations suitable for survival in high-performance grazing systems have been developed and have demonstrated superior anti bloat activity due to the increased grazing persistence. Fresh sainfoin is the best feed for cattle for maximum effect of CT, but if it needs to be preserved then hay would be better than silage in terms of preservation of the biological activity of CT. Although greater CT content is desirable for this forage in terms of antibloat and antiparasitic activity, sainfoin with CT concentration at about 50 g kg−1 dry matter (DM) offer the best feed value.",

		"abstract": "Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) is a tanniniferous legume that has been used as non-bloating forage for horses and ruminants for centuries, but so far its protein-rich seeds have not been utilized as a feedstuff for monogastric animals. In Europe, the main protein sources in diets for organic pigs are the grain legumes faba beans (Vicia faba) and peas (Pisum sativum), alongside the expensive high-quality components soybean cake, skimmed milk powder and potato protein. Because of the scarce supply of organic soybean cake and the highly variable yield of peas, alternative and locally produced protein sources are of great interest. As part of the EU Core Organic II research project ICOPP (improved contribution of local feed to support 100% organic feed supply to pigs and poultry), sainfoin seeds have been tested as a protein source for organic weaned piglets. In a feeding trial, a control diet, one diet containing 10% sainfoin seeds with hulls and two diets with 10 and 16% dehulled seeds, respectively (as fed basis) were fed to 137 piglets (crosses of [Pietrain × Duroc] × [Landrace × Large White]) during the 4-week post-weaning phase. The protein-rich components of the control diet were peas and soybean cake, which were partly substituted for sainfoin seeds in the experimental diets. Sainfoin seeds were found to contain 279 g kg−1 crude protein (388 g kg−1 when dehulled, as fed basis) with an amino acid proﬁle suitable for pig feeding. Neither feed intake and body weight gain nor feed conversion ratio differed between treatments. It is concluded that sainfoin seeds can be a valuable protein source in moderate percentages of 10–16% in organic diets for weaned piglets. Where sainfoin can be cultivated easily and the seeds are harvested, using them as feed for piglets can therefore be recommended.",

		"abstract": "This paper is devoted to studying chemical composition of the powder of the seeds of nontraditional legume, sainfoin. The experimental studies showed that crushed seeds of sainfoin make a flowing fine powder of light brown color with a pleasant unpronounced specific smell with floral notes. The taste is grassy with the after-taste typical for legumes. The chemical composition of sainfoin seeds is dominated by proteins and fiber, and fat content does not exceed 8%. The total content of amino-acids is 26.94/100 g of the product, with the share of indispensable ones being 37.85%. The limiting amino acid is tryptophan (48.0 %). By the composition of essential amino acids, proteins of sainfoin seeds are slightly inferior to the proteins of soybean seeds, but are better than the proteins of peanut seeds. The composition of fatty acid of the lipid complex of sainfoin seeds is dominated by (over 40% of the total) linolenic ù-3 acid with sufficiently low (less than 20% of the total) content of linoleic ù-6 acid. The lipid composition of sainfoin seeds, along with triacylglycerols, contains about 40% of related lipids, which are dominated by sterols, aliphatic alcohols, phospholipids and tocopherols. All this makes the lipid complex of sainfoin seed a promising means of adjusting fatty acids composition in food products of functional and specialized purpose, dietary supplements, and a valuable raw material for creating pharmaceutical substances and preparations. Adding sainfoin seeds powder into the nutritive medium has no inhibitory effect on development of the tested organism. At the same time, 58% of the organism’s physiological need for protein is satifsied, as compared to caseine.",

		"abstract": "Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed composition and yield are a function of genetics (G), environment (E), and management (M) practices, but contribution of each factor to seed composition and yield are not well understood. The goal of this synthesis-analysis was to identify the main effects of G, E, and M factors on seed composition (protein and oil concentration) and yield. The entire dataset (13,574 data points) consisted of 21 studies conducted across the United States (US) between 2002 and 2017 with varying treatments and all reporting seed yield and composition. Environment (E), defined as site-year, was the dominant factor accounting for more than 70% of the variation for both seed composition and yield. Of the crop management factors: (i) delayed planting date decreased oil concentration by 0.007 to 0.06% per delayed week (R2∼0.70) and a 0.01 to 0.04 Mg ha-1 decline in seed yield per week, mainly in northern latitudes (40–45 N); (ii) crop rotation (corn-soybean) resulted in an overall positive impact for both seed composition and yield (1.60 Mg ha-1 positive yield difference relative to continuous soybean); and (iii) other management practices such as no-till, seed treatment, foliar nutrient application, and fungicide showed mixed results. Fertilizer N application in lower quantities (10–50 kg N ha-1) increased both oil and protein concentration, but seed yield was improved with rates above 100 kg N ha-1. At southern latitudes (30–35 N), trends of reduction in oil and increases in protein concentrations with later maturity groups (MG, from 3 to 7) was found. Continuing coordinated research is critical to advance our understanding of G × E × M interactions.",

		"abstract": "Soybean (SB) production occupies close to 6% of the world's arable land. Soybean expansion is occurring much faster than with other major grains or oilseeds. Soybeans increasingly are being employed as the modern input of choice for buyers. They are mainly used as intermediate food, feed, and industrial inputs, not final consumer products, therefore remaining somewhat invisible in the economy. Only 2% of soybean protein is consumed directly by humans in the form of soy food products such as tofu, soy hamburger, or soy milk analogs. All but a very small percentage of the other 98% is processed into Soybean Meal (SBM) and fed to livestock, such as poultry and pigs. In this way, soybean demand is essentially a derived demand for meat. Soybean has risen to become a leading crop because the income elasticity of meat is high. This chapter provides an overview of soybean production, marketing, and utilization. The future of soybean production and utilization is bright because of the growing demand for protein. The United States continues to be the world's largest soybean producer with some of the world's lowest operating and logistics costs. New opportunities emerged with biodiesel that portend a significant new market for Soybean Oil (SBO).",

		"abstract": "Soybean is the preferred protein source for both poultry and swine feed. However, this preferred status is being challenged due to competition from alternative feed ingredients. To overcome this, it becomes necessary for breeders to develop soybean cultivars that contain higher protein and better nutritional composition. In this study, we have developed experimental soybean lines that not only contain significantly higher amounts of protein but also improved sulfur amino acid content. This objective was achieved by crossing a O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS) overexpressing transgenic soybean line with elevated levels of sulfur amino acid content (CS) with a high protein Korean soybean cultivar (Lee 5). Introgression of high protein and overexpression of OASS was monitored in the experimental lines at each successive generation (F2-F6) by measuring protein content and OASS activity. The average protein content of transgenic CS and Lee 5 seeds were 34.8 % and 44.7 %, while in the experimental soybean lines the protein content ranged from 41.3 %–47.7 %, respectively. HPLC and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that all the experimental lines developed in this study contained significantly higher amounts of sulfur containing amino acids and elemental sulfur in the seeds. The sulfur amino acid (cysteine + methionine) content of the experimental lines ranged from 1.1 % to 1.26 % while the parents Lee 5 and CS had 0.79 % and 1.1 %, respectively. SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis demonstrated that the accumulation of Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor and lunasin, two sulfur amino acid rich peptides, were elevated in experimental soybean lines. High-resolution 2D-gel electrophoresis and Delta2D gel analysis validated that an overall increase in the different subunits of 7S β-conglycinin and 11S glycinin were mainly responsible for the observed increase in the total amount of protein in experimental lines.",

		"abstract": "Background Protein may have both beneficial and detrimental effects on bone health depending on a variety of factors, including protein source. Objective The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) and select bone biomarkers in healthy adults. Methods Searches across five databases were conducted through 10/31/16 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies in healthy adults that examined the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on 1) total body (TB), total hip (TH), lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN) BMD or TB BMC for at least one year, or 2) select bone formation and resorption biomarkers for at least six months. Strength of evidence (SOE) was assessed and random effect meta-analyses were performed. Results Seven RCTs examining animal vs. isoflavone-rich soy (Soy+) protein intake in 633 healthy peri-menopausal (n = 1) and post-menopausal (n = 6) women were included. Overall risk of bias was medium. Limited SOE suggests no significant difference between Soy+ vs. animal protein on LS, TH, FN and TB BMD, TB BMC, and bone turnover markers BSAP and NTX. Meta-analysis results showed on average, the differences between Soy+ and animal protein groups were close to zero and not significant for BMD outcomes (LS: n = 4, pooled net % change: 0.24%, 95% CI: -0.80%, 1.28%; TB: n = 3, -0.24%, 95% CI: -0.81%, 0.33%; FN: n = 3, 0.13%, 95% CI: -0.94%, 1.21%). All meta-analyses had no statistical heterogeneity. Conclusions These results do not support soy protein consumption as more advantageous than animal protein, or vice versa. Future studies are needed examining the effects of different protein sources in different populations on BMD, BMC, and fracture.",

		"abstract": "Strong and rapid greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, far beyond those currently committed to, are required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. This allows no sector to maintain business as usual practices, while application of the precautionary principle requires avoiding a reliance on negative emission technologies. Animal to plant-sourced protein shifts offer substantial potential for GHG emission reductions. Unabated, the livestock sector could take between 37% and 49% of the GHG budget allowable under the 2°C and 1.5°C targets, respectively, by 2030. Inaction in the livestock sector would require substantial GHG reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors. This outlook article outlines why animal to plant-sourced protein shifts should be taken up by the Conference of the Parties (COP), and how they could feature as part of countries’ mitigation commitments under their updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to be adopted from 2020 onwards. The proposed framework includes an acknowledgment of ‘peak livestock’, followed by targets for large and rapid reductions in livestock numbers based on a combined ‘worst first’ and ‘best available food’ approach. Adequate support, including climate finance, is needed to facilitate countries in implementing animal to plant-sourced protein shifts.Key policy insights Given the livestock sector’s significant contribution to global GHG emissions and methane dominance, animal to plant protein shifts make a necessary contribution to meeting the Paris temperature goals and reducing warming in the short term, while providing a suite of co-benefits.Without action, the livestock sector could take between 37% and 49% of the GHG budget allowable under the 2°C and 1.5°C targets, respectively, by 2030.Failure to implement animal to plant protein shifts increases the risk of exceeding temperate goals; requires additional GHG reductions from other sectors; and increases reliance on negative emissions technologies.COP 24 is an opportunity to bring animal to plant protein shifts to the climate mitigation table.Revised NDCs from 2020 should include animal to plant protein shifts, starting with a declaration of ‘peak livestock’, followed by a ‘worst first’ replacement approach, guided by ‘best available food’.",

We investigated the effects of partial replacement of dietary animal proteins with plant-based ones on intake of energy-yielding nutrients, fibre, and plasma lipoproteins. This 12-week randomised clinical intervention comprised 107 women and 29 men (20–69 years) in three diet groups with different dietary protein compositions (“ANIMAL”: Animal 70%/plant 30%; “50/50”: Animal 50%/plant 50%; “PLANT”: Animal 30%/plant 70%; all: Protein intake 17 E%). Nutrient intakes were assessed by 4-day food records. Saturated fat intake (E%) was lower and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (E%) higher in the PLANT and 50/50 groups compared to the ANIMAL group (p < 0.001 for all). Fibre intake was higher in the PLANT (p ˂ 0.001) and 50/50 (p = 0.012) groups. Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the PLANT than in the ANIMAL group (p = 0.003 for both) but no differences in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides were observed (p > 0.05). Replacing animal protein with plant protein sources in the diet led to an increased fibre intake and improved dietary fat quality as well as blood lipoprotein profile. Flexitarian diets could provide healthy and more sustainable alternatives for the current, predominantly animal-based diets.",

		"abstract": "Proteins are essential macronutrients for the human diet. They are the primary source of nitrogen and are fundamental for body structure and functions. The plant protein quality (PPQ) refers to the bioavailability, digestibility, and amino acid composition. The digestibility specifies the protein quantity absorbed by an organism relative to the consumed amount and depends on the protein structure, previous processing, and the presence of compounds limiting the digestion. The latter are so-called antinutritional factors (ANF), exemplified by phytates, tannins, trypsin inhibitors, and lectins. Animal proteins are known to have better digestibility than plant proteins due to the presence of ANF in plants. Thus, the inactivation of ANF throughout food processing may increase the PPQ. New food processing, aiming to increase the digestibility of plant proteins, and new sources of proteins are being studied for the animal protein substitution. Here, it is presented the impact of processing on the protein digestibility and reduction of ANF. Several techniques, such as cooking, autoclaving, germination, microwave, irradiation, spray- and freeze-drying, fermentation, and extrusion enhanced the PPQ. The emerging non-thermal technologies impact on protein functionalities but require studies on the protein digestibility. How to accurately determine and how to improve the protein digestibility of a plant source remains a scientific and technological challenge that may be addressed by novel or combining existing processing techniques, as well as by exploring protein-enriched by-products of the food industry.",

		"abstract": "Proteins are essential to human nutrition and health, and it is crucial for the development of the human body. While animal proteins are considered to be the primary dietary protein source for decades, there is a paradigm shift in recent years on the dietary consumption patterns among the general population towards plant-based food proteins. As a result, plant protein production in the food industry has skyrocketed. Research has led to a closer look at diverse plant sources and their capacity to replace conventional animal-based proteins for health and environmental reasons. Soy protein is a high-quality protein with a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of 1.00, which is close to some of the proteins from animal sources, such as meat and dairy. Soy proteins contain well-balanced essential amino acids except for sulfur-containing ones like methionine. They also have desirable textures with endless possibilities to formulate various sophisticated soy-based food products. Due to their high protein content and versatility in developing food products, soy proteins are the primary supply of plant-based proteins and are widely consumed by diverse populations worldwide. This review first briefly compared plant-based proteins with animal proteins regarding their health and environmental benefits, amino acid composition, and protein digestibility.

		"abstract": "Pulses display nutritional benefits and are recommended in sustainable diets. Indeed, they are rich in proteins and fibers, and can contain variable amounts of micronutrients. However, pulses also contain bioactive compounds such as phytates, saponins, or polyphenols/tannins that can exhibit ambivalent nutritional properties depending on their amount in the diet. We characterized the nutritional composition and bioactive compound content of five types of prepared pulses frequently consumed in France (kidney beans, white beans, chickpeas, brown and green lentils, flageolets), and specifically compared the effects of household cooking vs. canning on the composition of pulses that can be consumed one way or the other. The contents in macro-, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds highly varied from one pulse to another (i.e., 6.9 to 9.7 g/100 g of cooked product for proteins, 4.6 to 818.9 µg/100 g for lutein or 15.0 to 284.3 mg/100 g for polyphenols). The preparation method was a key factor governing pulse final nutritional composition in hydrophilic compounds, depending on pulse species. Canning led to a greater decrease in proteins, total dietary fibers, magnesium or phytate contents compared to household cooking (i.e., −30%, −44%, −33% and −38%, p < 0.05, respectively, in kidney beans). As canned pulses are easy to use for consumers, additional research is needed to improve their transformation process to further optimize their nutritional quality.",

		"abstract": "An alternative to the time-consuming and expensive PER assay for measuring food protein quality is needed by the food industry. Many biological and chemical-based assays for measuring protein quality have been described in the literature. Most of these are still too complicated, time-consuming, or too narrow in the range of foods they will test for daily quality control use. In the past five years, rapid methods have been developed that employ chemical assays for essential amino acid composition and availability or biological assays that measure protein digestibility and growth on food proteins. Most of these assays can be completed in five days or less and are applicable to a broad range of foods. These developments have brightened the prospects for the eventual development of a rapid assay that the food industry routinely can use to monitor protein quality. This paper has discussed two assays that were tested with a wide variety of foods and that take less than 72 hr to complete. The C-PER assay, uses data on the in vitro protein digestibility and EAA composition of a food protein to predict its protein quality in terms of PER. The C-PER technique is not limited by the protein, fat, additive or spice levels in the food to be tested, and is therefore applicable to a wide range of food ingredients and processed foods. The second assay is based on the growth of the protozoanTetrahymena thermophila WH14 on a proteolytic enzyme hydrolyzed food sample along with in vitro protein digestibility data to predict protein quality in terms of T-PER. Because theTetrahymena are more difficult to control on a day to day basis, the error of the T-PER estimate is greater than that for the C-PER estimate. Also, sinceTetrahymena growth is greatly affected by various food additives and spices, caution should be used when this assay is used to measure protein quality in foods where the composition is not definitely known. The T-PER assay is best suited for assaying protein quality in protein-containing food ingredients, such as meats, flours, protein concentrates and isolates, or on foods where the exact composition is known.",

		"abstract": "Protein quality describes characteristics of a protein in relation to its ability to achieve defined metabolic actions. Traditionally, this has been discussed solely in the context of a protein's ability to provide specific patterns of amino acids to satisfy the demands for synthesis of protein as measured by animal growth or, in humans, nitrogen balance. As understanding of protein's actions expands beyond its role in maintaining body protein mass, the concept of protein quality must expand to incorporate these newly emerging actions of protein into the protein quality concept. New research reveals increasingly complex roles for protein and amino acids in regulation of body composition and bone health, gastrointestinal function and bacterial flora, glucose homeostasis, cell signaling, and satiety. The evidence available to date suggests that quality is important not only at the minimum Recommended Dietary Allowance level but also at higher intakes. Currently accepted methods for measuring protein quality do not consider the diverse roles of indispensable amino acids beyond the first limiting amino acid for growth or nitrogen balance. As research continues to evolve in assessing protein's role in optimal health at higher intakes, there is also need to continue to explore implications for protein quality assessment.",

Removal of these unwanted components promises improved utilization of dry beans for human food purposes. The current methodology of removing these factors includes several food processing techniques such as soaking, dry and moist heat treatment, filtration, germination, and fermentation. The commercial feasibility of these processes will be discussed.

		"abstract": "Pulses, the dry edible seeds of plants in the legume family, include field pea, dry bean, lentil, chickpea, and fababean. The contemporary definition of pulses excludes oilseed legumes and legumes consumed in immature form. Pulses have been nourishing people around the world for thousands of years and are well known as a rich, sustainable source of protein that is high in lysine and therefore complementary to protein from cereals. They also are good sources of energy and dietary fiber, are low in fat, and contain significant levels of vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients and bioactives. Owing to its intermediate amylose content, starch from pulses is digested more slowly than are most cereal and tuber starches. Whole and split pulses and pulse flours also exhibit relatively high levels of type 1 resistant starch. As a result, the consumption of pulses is beneficial to the management of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and contributes to overall health and wellness. Pulses are used in whole or dehulled form in canned goods, sweets, soups, and pastes, whereas pulse flours are becoming common ingredients in a wide variety of food and pet food products such as baked goods, pasta and noodles, biscuits, and condiments. There is considerable interest currently in dry and wet fractionation of pulses into starch, protein, and fiber concentrates for use in both food and nonfood applications. As consumers are becoming increasingly health conscious and focused on a wellness-oriented lifestyle, they are demanding tasty and convenient food products that are plant-based and provide both nutritional and health benefits. In recent years, interest in the use of pulses and their ingredients in food formulation has grown tremendously owing to their nutritional and health benefits and unique functionality, a rise in the incidence of food allergies, and the availability of novel processing technologies. The United Nations declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, which was celebrated through the hosting of scientific and educational activities worldwide, all aimed at increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of pulse consumption and of the role of pulses in sustainable crop production systems. The ultimate goal was increased production and consumption of pulses in both developed and developing countries. This focus issue of Cereal Chemistry captures current research related to pulse composition, processing technologies, nutritional and functional attributes of pulse ingredients, impacts of processing on composition and functionality, potential health benefits, and novel food applications. It also includes review articles on composition, nutritional value and health benefits, traditional and new food uses, determination of protein nutritional quality, evaluation of cooking time, effects of processing on antinutrients, and flavor aspects of ingredients.",

Recent research has investigated how innovative processes such as extrusion, microwave heating, micronization, and irradiation affect the antinutrient content. Germination tends to be most effective at reducing phytate levels, regardless of pulse type. Mixed results on the effectiveness of extrusion, microwave heating, and micronization have been reported.

		"abstract": "Soybean seeds are one of the best sources of plant-based high-quality proteins and oils. The contents of these metabolites are affected by both environmental and genetic factors. In this study, 49 soybean germplasms were cultivated in Korea, the contents of total protein, total oil and five fatty acids were determined, and the influences of seed coat color and seed weight on each were assessed. The total protein and total oil contents were evaluated using Kjeldahl and Soxhlet methods and were in the ranges of 36.28-44.19% and 13.45-19.20%, respectively. Moreover, the contents of individual fatty acids were determined as area percentage from acquired gas-chromatography peaks. The contents of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were in the ranges of 9.90-12.55, 2.45-4.00, 14.97-38.74, 43.22-60.26, and 5.37-12.33%, respectively and each significantly varied between the soybean germplasms. Unlike total oil and fatty acid contents, total protein content was not significantly affected by both seed coat color and seed weight. Cluster analysis grouped the soybeans into two classes with notable content differences. Fatty acids were the main factors for the variabilities seen between the soybean germplasms as observed in the principal component analysis. Correlation analysis revealed a significant but negative association between total oil and total protein contents (r = -0.714, p < 0.0001). Besides, a trade-off relationship was observed between oleic acid and linoleic acid (r = -0.936, p < 0.0001) which was reflected with respect to both seed coat color and seed weight. Among all colored soybeans, pale-yellow soybeans had the highest and the lowest levels of oleic acid and linoleic acid, respectively each being significantly different from the rest of colored soybeans (p < 0.05). Likewise, oleic acid content increased with seed weight while that of linoleic acid decreased with seed weight (p < 0.05). In general, this study showed the significance of seed coat color and seed weight to discriminate soybean genotypes, mainly in terms of their fatty acid contents. Moreover, the soybean germplasms with distinct characters and fatty acid contents identified in this study could be important genetic resources for cultivar development.",

		"abstract": "Pulses are good sources of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, phytosterols and non-digestible carbohydrates that play important physiological as well as metabolic roles. These compounds vary in concentration amongst different pulse species and varieties. Pulse seed coats are rich in water-insoluble fibres and polyphenols (having high antioxidant activities), while cotyledons contain higher soluble fibres, oligosaccharides, slowly digestible and resistant starch content. Ferulic acid is the most abundant phenolic acid present in pulses, while flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins and tannins are responsible for the seed coat colour. Sitosterol (most abundant), stigmasterol, and campesterol are the major phytosterols present in pulses. Pulse fibres, resistant starch and oligosaccharides function as probiotics and possess several other health benefits such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, and reduce glucose as well as lipid levels. Beans and peas contain higher amounts of oligosaccharides than other pulses. Processing methods affect resistant starch, polyphenol composition and generally increase antioxidant activities of different pulses. In this review, the current information on pulse polyphenols, phytosterols, resistant starch, dietary fibre, oligosaccharides, antioxidant and associated health benefits are discussed.",

The accessions were grouped accordingly to several seed traits (size, shape, colour, variety and surface) that affected ﬁnal viscosity, cooking time, hydration capacity and seed weight. In general, seed weight was correlated with hydration capacity. Among species, faba bean revealed higher values of pasting parameters. Cooking time was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with ﬁnal viscosity (–0.298) and positively correlated with seed weight (0.601). The general variance was analysed by using principal component analysis, which allowed identiﬁcation of speciﬁc accessions with important traits such as higher protein or ﬁbre content, hydration capacity or seed weight.",

Significant varietal differences were observed in the tannin content of the four pulses. Decortication of the pulse resulted in 83–97% loss of tannin. As a result of overnight soaking in water, 50% of tannin was lost in pigeonpea and chickpea while in blackgram and greengram the loss was 25%. When germination was continued for 48 h, a further 10% loss of tannin was observed in pigeonpea and chickpea varieties and 25% loss in blackgram and greengram varieties. Cooking of raw pulse brought about a 70% decrease in their tannin content. Loss of tannin during germination may be due to enzymatic degradation. Thus traditional methods employed for pulse processing are able to remove a major part of the tannin present in the pulse.",

The fatty acid composition of the seed adds value because fats govern the texture, shelf-life, flavor, aroma, and nutritional composition of chickpea-based food products. Therefore, the biofortification of essential fatty acids has become a nutritional breeding target for chickpea crop improvement programs worldwide. This paper examines global chickpea production, focusing on plant lipids, their functions, and their benefits to human health. In addition, this paper also reviews the chemical analysis of essential fatty acids and possible breeding targets to enrich essential fatty acids in chickpea (Cicer arietinum) biofortification. Biofortification of chickpea for essential fatty acids within safe levels will improve human health and support food processing to retain the quality and flavor of chickpea-based food products. Essential fatty acid biofortification is possible by phenotyping diverse chickpea germplasm over suitable locations and years and identifying the candidate genes responsible for quantitative trait loci mapping using genome-wide association mapping.",

		"abstract": "Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important pulse crop grown and consumed all over the world, especially in the Afro-Asian countries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, and protein quality is considered to be better than other pulses. Chickpea has significant amounts of all the essential amino acids except sulphur-containing amino acids, which can be complemented by adding cereals to the daily diet. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fibre, oligosaccharides and simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Although lipids are present in low amounts, chickpea is rich in nutritionally important unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and oleic acids. β-Sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol are important sterols present in chickpea oil. Ca, Mg, P and, especially, K are also present in chickpea seeds. Chickpea is a good source of important vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin, thiamin, folate and the vitamin A precursor β-carotene. As with other pulses, chickpea seeds also contain anti-nutritional factors which can be reduced or eliminated by different cooking techniques. Chickpea has several potential health benefits, and, in combination with other pulses and cereals, it could have beneficial effects on some of the important human diseases such as CVD, type 2 diabetes, digestive diseases and some cancers. Overall, chickpea is an important pulse crop with a diverse array of potential nutritional and health benefits.",

		"abstract": "The industrial activities of the last century have caused massive increases in human exposure to heavy metals. Mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium, and arsenic have been the most common heavy metals that induced human poisonings. Here, we reviewed the mechanistic action of these heavy metals according to the available animal and human studies. Acute or chronic poisonings may occur following exposure through water, air, and food. Bioaccumulation of these heavy metals leads to a diversity of toxic effects on a variety of body tissues and organs. Heavy metals disrupt cellular events including growth, proliferation, differentiation, damage-repairing processes, and apoptosis. Comparison of the mechanisms of action reveals similar pathways for these metals to induce toxicity including ROS generation, weakening of the antioxidant defense, enzyme inactivation, and oxidative stress. On the other hand, some of them have selective binding to specific macromolecules. The interaction of lead with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase is within this context. Reactions of other heavy metals with certain proteins were discussed as well. Some toxic metals including chromium, cadmium, and arsenic cause genomic instability. Defects in DNA repair following the induction of oxidative stress and DNA damage by the three metals have been considered as the cause of their carcinogenicity. Even with the current knowledge of hazards of heavy metals, the incidence of poisoning remains considerable and requires preventive and effective treatment. The application of chelation therapy for the management of metal poisoning could be another aspect of heavy metals to be reviewed in the future.",

		"abstract": "Understanding dietary patterns is vital to reducing the number of people experiencing hunger (about 795 million), micronutrient deficiencies (2 billion), and overweight or obesity (2.1 billion). We characterize global trends in dietary quality by estimating micronutrient density of the food supply, prevalence of inadequate intake of 14 micronutrients, and average prevalence of inadequate intake of these micronutrients for all countries between 1961 and 2011. Over this 50-year period, the estimated prevalence of inadequate intakes of micronutrients has declined in all regions due to increased total production of food and/or micronutrient density. This decline has been particularly strong in East and Southeast Asia and weaker in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where dietary micronutrient density has declined over this 50-year period. At the global level, micronutrients with the lowest levels of adequate estimated intake are calcium, iron, vitamin A, and zinc, but there are strong differences between countries and regions. Fortification has reduced the estimated prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes in all low-income regions, except South Asia. The food supply in many countries is still far below energy requirements, which suggests a need to increase the availability and accessibility of nutritious foods. Countries where the food energy supply is adequate show a very large variation in dietary quality, and in many of these countries people would benefit from more diverse diets with a greater proportion of micronutrient-dense foods. Dietary quality can be improved through fortification, biofortification, and agricultural diversification, as well as efforts to improve access to and use of micronutrient-dense foods and nutritional knowledge. Reducing poverty and increasing education, especially of women, are integral to sustainably addressing malnutrition.",

		"abstract": "Surveys in high-income countries show that inadequacies and deficiencies can be common for some nutrients, particularly in vulnerable subgroups of the population. Inadequate intakes, high requirements for rapid growth and development, or age- or disease-related impairments in nutrient intake, digestion, absorption, or increased nutrient losses can lead to micronutrient deficiencies. The consequent subclinical conditions are difficult to recognize if not screened for and often go unnoticed. Nutrient deficiencies can be persistent despite primary nutrition interventions that are aimed at improving dietary intakes. Secondary prevention that targets groups at high risk of inadequacy or deficiency, such as in the primary care setting, can be a useful complementary approach to address persistent nutritional gaps. However, this strategy is often underestimated and overlooked as potentially cost-effective means to prevent future health care costs and to improve the health and quality of life of individuals. In this paper, the authors discuss key appraisal criteria to consider when evaluating the benefits and disadvantages of a secondary prevention of nutrient deficiencies through screening.",

The consumption of a varied and balanced diet from the preconceptional period is essential to ensure both maternal well-being and pregnancy outcomes. However, the risk of inadequate intakes of specific micronutrients in pregnancy and lactation is high even in the most industrialized countries. This particularly applies to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamin D, also in the Italian population. Moreover, the risk of not reaching the adequate nutrient supply is increased for selected groups of women of childbearing age: those following exclusion diets, underweight or overweight/obese, smokers, adolescents, mothers who have had multiple or close pregnancies, and those with previous unfavorable pregnancy outcomes.",

		"abstract": "Breast-fed infants and young children need complementary foods with a very high nutrient density (particularly for iron and zinc), especially at ages 6-12 mo. However, in low-income countries, their diet is usually dominated by cereal-based porridges with low nutrient density and poor mineral bioavailability. Complementary feeding diets typically fall short in iron and zinc and sometimes in other nutrients. These gaps in nutritional adequacy of infant diets have likely been a characteristic of human diets since the agricultural revolution ~10,000 y ago. Estimates of nutrient intakes before then, based on hypothetical diets of preagricultural humans, suggest that infants had much higher intakes of key nutrients than is true today and would have been able to meet their nutrient needs from the combination of breast milk and premasticated foods provided by their mothers. Strategies for achieving adequate nutrition for infants and young children in modern times must address the challenge of meeting nutrient needs from largely cereal-based diets.",

Iron and zinc in vitro availabilities of whole pearl millet flour were significantly improved by phytate degradation, even if the IP6 were not all degraded.

		"abstract": "Purpose Iron deficiency anaemia and zinc deficiency are major public health problems across the globe. Cereals and pulses are important vegetarian source of minerals like zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe), however, poor digestibility impairs proper availability of micro minerals in the body. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) were selected for study as they are important pulse crops consumed worldwide. Therefore, in order to remove antinutrients and enhance bioavailability of nutrients in chickpea and cowpea, extrusion cooking was selected as a technology and its impact was studied by an in vitro method. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Four chickpea cultivars, two desi (K 850 and PUSA 362) and two kabuli (PUSA 1108 and PUSA 1053) and one cowpea (Gomati) cultivars were selected for the study. Pulses were processed in a laboratory using a single screw food extruder. Raw and extruded pulses were analysed for antinutrients content, micronutrients content (Fe, Zn) and their bioavailability. Findings Extrusion cooking significantly decreased phytate in all cultivars of chick pea and cowpea with highest reduction (72.92 per cent) in PUSA 362; similarly, tannin and trypsin inhibitor decreased by 87.5 and 71.54 per cent, respectively, in Gomati cultivar of cowpea. All cultivars showed significant increase in protein digestibility. Iron bioavailability in all samples enhanced significantly; however, only 50 per cent cultivars (K 850, PUSA 362 and PUSA 1108) showed improvement in Zn bioavailability. Originality/value The present research therefore brought the outcome as an enhanced in vitro protein digestibility and bioavailability of micro mineral and protein in certain pulses having minimized antinutrients. Therefore, it is concluded that extrusion cooking is an effective tool in enhancing protein and micro mineral bioavailability.",

Proteins, lipids, fibers, vitamin E, lutein, 5-methyl-tetrahydro-folate, magnesium, iron, phytates, saponins and tannins were quantified. Bioaccessibility and intestinal uptake of vitamin D and K were assessed using in vitro digestion and Caco-2 cells, respectively. Significant reductions of phytate, saponin and tannin contents (−16 to −44%), but also of folate content (up to −97%) were observed under optimized canning conditions compared with the control.

In the present study, the genetic variability and heritability for seed Fe and Zn content was studied. The effect of genotypes was significant for all the quality traits indicating presence of enough variability among the blackgram genotypes for the traits. The Fe content in 26 blackgram genotypes ranged from 71.02 to 100.20 ppm, whereas Zn content ranged from 18.93 to 60.58 ppm. Maximum Fe as well as Zn was recorded in genotype SHEKHAR 2 (100.2 and 60.58 ppm respectively). The Phytic acid and polyphenol content among genotypes varied significantly and it ranged from 0.06–0.37% to 5.88–9.03 mg/g, respectively. High phytic acid content was recorded in black gram genotypes COBG 653, Nodai Urd, NP 03 and PKG U 03, whereas high polyphenol content was recorded in PU 31, IPU 99-200, PDU 1 and YAKUBPUR 2. Blackgram genotype COBG 653 had high phytic acid but low polyphenol content. The genotype × year interaction was significant for all the traits under study which indicates differential reaction to the expression of quality characters over years. Fe content in blackgram genotypes showed significant positive phenotypic correlation with Zn content while at genotypic level in addition to Zn, it showed positive correlation with phytic acid and polyphenol content as well. This indicates that although the traits are genotypically correlated, the expression is masked by the environmental influence. This is further exhibited from low heritability estimates for phytic acid and polyphenol content among the genotypes.",

		"abstract": "The mineral content of legumes is generally high, but the bioavailability is poor due to the presence of phytate, which is a main inhibitor of Fe and Zn absorption. Some legumes also contain considerable amounts of Fe-binding polyphenols inhibiting Fe absorption. Furthermore, soya protein per se has an inhibiting effect on Fe absorption. Efficient removal of phytate, and probably also polyphenols, can be obtained by enzymatic degradation during food processing, either by increasing the activity of the naturally occurring plant phytases and polyphenol degrading enzymes, or by addition of enzyme preparations. Biological food processing techniques that increase the activity of the native enzymes are soaking, germination, hydrothermal treatment and fermentation. Food processing can be optimized towards highest phytate degradation provided that the optimal conditions for phytase activity in the plant is known. In contrast to cereals, some legumes have highest phytate degradation at neutral or alkaline pH. Addition of microbial enzyme preparations seems to be the most efficient for complete degradation during processing. Fe and Zn absorption have been shown to be low from legume-based diets. It has also been demonstrated that nutritional Fe deficiency reaches its greatest prevalence in populations subsisting on cereal- and legume-based diets. However, in a balanced diet containing animal protein a high intake of legumes is not considered a risk in terms of mineral supply. Furthermore, once phytate, and in certain legumes polyphenols, is degraded, legumes would become good sources of Fe and Zn as the content of these minerals is high.",

First, the breeding must be successful?high nutrient density must be combined with high yields and high profitability. Second, efficacy must be demonstrated?the micronutrient status of human subjects must be shown to improve when they are consuming the biofortified varieties as normally eaten. Thus, sufficient nutrients must be retained in processing and cooking and these nutrients must be sufficiently bioavailable. Third, the biofortified crops must be adopted by farmers and consumed by those suffering from micronutrient malnutrition in significant numbers.ResultsBiofortified crops offer a rural-based intervention that, by design, initially reaches these more remote populations, which comprise a majority of the under-nourished in many countries, and then penetrates to urban populations as production surpluses are marketed. In this way, biofortification complements fortification and supplementation programs, which work best in centralized urban areas and then reach into rural areas with good infrastructure.ConclusionsInitial investments in agricultural research at a central location can generate high recurrent benefits at low cost as adapted, biofortified varieties become available in country after country across time at low recurrent costs.",

Different interventions are currently used, but their overall coverage is relatively limited. Biofortification—that is, breeding staple food crops for higher micronutrient contents—is a new agriculture-based approach, but relatively little is known about its ramifications. Here, the main factors influencing success are discussed and a methodology for economic impact assessment is presented. Ex ante studies from India and other countries suggest that biofortified crops can reduce the problem of micronutrient malnutrition in a cost-effective way, when targeted to specific situations. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings and address certain issues still unresolved.",

Pulses and legumes are important source of plant protein in many diets. They are also an excellent reservoir of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates resulting in low GI (glycemic index). Pulses play vital role in metabolic and physiological processes due to the presence of various bioactive compounds, and the majority of them are phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins. Pulses and legumes are also a good source of 15 essential minerals and vitamins, but their bioavailability is low due to the presence of antinutrient factors in it.

		"abstract": "Anaemia is typically the first clue to iron deficiency, but an isolated haemoglobin measurement has both low specificity and low sensitivity. The latter can be improved by including measures of iron-deficient erythropoiesis such as the transferrin iron saturation, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, percentage of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocyte haemoglobin concentration. However, the changes in these measurements with iron deficiency are indistinguishable from those seen in patients with the anaemia of chronic disease. The optimal diagnostic approach is to measure the serum ferritin as an index of iron stores and the serum transferrin receptor as a index of tissue iron deficiency. The treatment of iron deficiency should always be initiated with oral iron. When this fails because of large blood losses, iron malabsorption, or intolerance to oral iron, parenteral iron can be given using iron dextran, iron gluconate or iron sucrose.",

The IVPD values of genotypes of mung bean, urd bean and soybean ranged from 67.2 to 72.2 percent, 55.7 to 63.3 percent and 62.7 to 71.6 percent, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between phytic acid and IVPD of these genotypes. Phytic acid was significantly and positively correlated with protein but the magnitude of correlation was very low in chickpea and pigeonpea.

The negative charge on PA attracts and chelates metal cations resulting in a mixed insoluble salt, phytate. Phytate contains six negatively charged ions, chelates divalent cations such as Fe2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ rendering them unavailable for absorption by monogastric animals. This may lead to micronutrient deficiencies in humans since they lack the enzyme phytase that hydrolyzes phytate and releases the bound micronutrients. There are two main concerns about the presence of PA in human diet. The first is its negative impact on the bioavailability of several minerals and the second is the evidence of PA inhibiting various proteases essential for protein degradation and the subsequent digestion in stomach and small intestine. The beneficial role of PA has been underestimated due to its distinct negative consequences. PA is reported to be a potent natural plant antioxidant which plays a protective role against oxidative stress in seeds and preventive role in various human diseases. Recently beneficial roles of PA as an antidiabetic and antibacterial agent has been reported. Thus, the development of grains with low-PA and modified distribution pattern can be achieved through fine-tuning of its content in the seeds.",

Indeed, the first step in mineral absorption requires that the mineral remains in the ionic state. As the PA content of the diet increases, the intestinal absorption of zinc, iron and calcium decreases. The inhibitory effects of PA on magnesium or copper are more controversial. Nevertheless, PA does not occur alone in foods and is often consumed with various compounds. Phytates are always present in vegetal matrix composed of fibres, minerals, trace elements and other phytomicronutrients. Thus, in order to evaluate mineral absorption from phytate-rich products, all components of diet and food interactions should be considered and it is hard to predict mineral bioavailability in such products by using only the phytate content.",

However, the displacement of pulses from the diet by low fiber protein alternatives has resulted in a pervasive deficiency referred to as the dietary fiber gap. Using an analytical method American Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) 2011.25 that conforms to the Codex Alimentarius Commission consensus definition for dietary fiber, the fiber content of these pulse crops was evaluated in seed types used for commercial production. These pulse crops have 2 to 3 times more fiber per 100 g edible portion than other dietary staples. Moreover, there is marked variation in fiber content among cultivars of the same crop. We conclude that pulse crop consumption should be emphasized in efforts to close the dietary fiber gap. The substantial differences in fiber content among currently available cultivars within a crop can be used to further improve gains in fiber intake without the need to change dietary habits. This provides a rationale for cultivar-based food labeling.",

		"abstract": "Prebiotic carbohydrates are compounds that include simple sugars, sugar alcohols, and raffinose family oligosaccharides, which are fermented by gut bacteria and can influence the species profile of the gut microbiome to reduce obesity and weight gain. Prebiotic carbohydrates are also associated with several health benefits including reduced insulin dependence and incidence of colorectal cancer. Although pulse crops such as chickpea have been important sources of nutrition for human diets for thousands of years, relatively little is known about the profiles of prebiotic carbohydrates in pulse crops. The objectives of this study were to characterize the type and concentration of seed prebiotic carbohydrates in 18 kabuli chickpea genotypes grown in 2017 and 2018 in Idaho and Washington, and partition variance components conditioning these nutritional quality traits in chickpea. Genotype effects were significant for fructose, sucrose, raffinose, and kestose. Environment effects were also significant for several carbohydrates. However, year effects were the greatest sources of variance for all carbohydrates. Concentrations of most carbohydrates were significantly greater in 2017, when there was less precipitation during the growing season coupled with greater heat stress during grain filling than in 2018. This may reflect the role of many of these carbohydrates as osmoprotectants produced in response to heat and water stress. Overall, our results suggest that a survey of more genetically diverse plant materials, such as a chickpea ‘mini-core' collection, may reveal genotypes that produce significantly greater concentrations of selected prebiotic carbohydrates and could be used to introduce desirable nutritional traits into adapted chickpea cultivars.",

Cooking peas by two different methods resulted in 13% phytate reduction. Peas incubated 6.5 hr from 25 to 80°C yielded maximum phytate loss (25%) at 60°C due to phytase activated hydrolysis. Germination (10 d) decreased pea phytate 75% and increased phytase activity 12-fold. Semi-purified germinated pea phytase showed temperature optimum at 45°C, pH optimum of 5.2, 30% inhibition by 1 mM inorganic P, and substrate preference for pyrophosphate. Incubation of early germinated peas at optima pH and temperature is suggested for maximum phytate reduction.",

Extrusion is used by the food industry to produce a wide variety of food products, such as ready-to-eat foods (e.g., snacks), among others. Pulses have also gained popularity as novel food ingredients in the formulation of a variety of food and food products, due to their high content of macro and micronutrients, and bioactive compounds that improve the nutritional and functional properties of the final food products. In this review, the impact of extrusion variables on proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, phenolics and antinutritional compounds in pulses and pulse-based formulations are highlighted. Particularly, the impact of the specific mechanical energy. Also, the preservation, increase and/or reduction in those functional compounds, as a consequence of different extrusion processing conditions, are discussed.",

Proposed health benefits are related to both the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Resistance to digestion seems to be a prerequisite to exert their beneficial properties, either at local or systemic level. In vitro and in vivo approaches have demonstrated the potential of Bowman–Birk inhibitors and lunasin as anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic agents within the gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, resistant carbohydrates to digestion, that comprises soluble and insoluble fibre, resistant starch and oligosaccharides, are major responsible of the low glycemic index of legume foods. Recent findings have demonstrated the key role of these dietary carbohydrates as modulators of intestinal microbiota composition and bowel motility, glucose homeostasis and cholesterolemia.",

		"abstract": "Public health concerns are discussed so frequently that it is beginning to cause desensitization. And yet, rates of chronic disease remain alarmingly high worldwide—or are even increasing. Primary prevention is essential to reverse these trends. Indeed, the sustainable implementation of good health practices can promote human physical and psychological well-being while simultaneously being more cost-effective than the treatment of chronic disease. A healthy dietary pattern is a cornerstone of primary prevention. Pulses, or the dry seeds of non-oilseed legumes (e.g., chickpeas, cowpeas, dry beans, dry peas, and lentils)—also called grain legumes—are widely recognized as a nutrient-dense food and one of the richest sources of dietary fiber and plant protein. Combined with their affordable price point and contributions to sustainable food systems, they can be considered a prime example of a superfood. Historically, they also have a rich culinary history around the world, making them culturally relevant to many cuisines and cultures. The scientific literature supports the role of pulses in many health benefits, yet the quality of the evidence is often low. In this review, we explore the findings—and limitations—of research to date and conclude with suggestions for moving the field forward to investigate and establish robust support for a recommended serving size that is most beneficial for human health.",

The WHO lists four key metabolic changes that increase the chance of dying from chronic diseases: elevated blood pressure, overweight/obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.

The scientific evidence supports that increasing consumption of dry beans and other pulses may be a sustainable way to help combat the current obesity epidemic and prevent many of the most common chronic diseases, including certain types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Despite the numerous health benefits, consumption of pulses continues to be low, particularly in developed countries.

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Legumes, including beans, chickpeas, and lentils, are among the lowest glycemic index (GI) foods and have been recommended in national diabetes mellitus (DM) guidelines. Yet, to our knowledge, they have never been used specifically to lower the GI of the diet. We have therefore undertaken a study of low-GI foods in type 2 DM with a focus on legumes in the intervention.\nMETHODS: A total of 121 participants with type 2 DM were randomized to either a low-GI legume diet that encouraged participants to increase legume intake by at least 1 cup per day, or to increase insoluble fiber by consumption of whole wheat products, for 3 months. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values with calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk score as a secondary outcome.\nRESULTS: The low-GI legume diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.5% (95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%) and the high wheat fiber diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.3% (95% CI, -0.4% to -0.2%). The relative reduction in HbA1c values after the low-GI legume diet was greater than after the high wheat fiber diet by -0.2% (95% CI, -0.3% to -0.1%; P < .001). The respective CHD risk reduction on the low-GI legume diet was -0.8% (95% CI, -1.4% to -0.3%; P = .003), largely owing to a greater relative reduction in systolic blood pressure on the low-GI legume diet compared with the high wheat fiber diet (-4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.0 to -2.1 mm Hg; P < .001).\nCONCLUSION: Incorporation of legumes as part of a low-GI diet improved both glycemic control and reduced calculated CHD risk score in type 2 DM.",

An awareness of the consequences of obesity on the health and well-being of individuals is evident in the plethora of strategic plans at the local and national levels, most of which have largely fallen short of their goals. If interventions continue to be unsuccessful, it is estimated that approximately three of four Americans will be overweight or obese by 2020. Prevention of excess weight gain can be accomplished with relatively small changes in lifestyle behaviours to control body weight. Small sustainable changes are perhaps better than efforts to achieve larger changes that cannot be sustained. Legumes can be a valuable food by which the needs of the undernourished or under-served populations could be met. They can be incorporated into meat products, such as sausages and burgers, to lower the energy density of these foods while providing important nutrients. Replacing energy-dense foods with legumes has been shown to have beneficial effects on the prevention and management of obesity and related disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. This review explores the nutritional value and obesity-related health benefits of legume consumption while focusing on pulses.",

It is suggested that a new term, dietary fiber complex (DFC), should include all substances of DF plus all chemical compounds naturally associated with, and concentrated around, these structural polymers. CF supplies from starchy staples, wheat and potato, in England and Wales were probably stationary from 1770 to 1860, fell greatly from 1860 to 1910, rose during food controls in 1942 to 1953, and declined slightly from 1954 to 1970. It is postulated that fiber is a protective factor against certain colonic disorders, such as diverticular disease, and certain metabolic diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These three diseases had changing trends of mortality rates in England during the food control years. Westernization of African diets is accompanied by a large fall in CF from starchy foods and vegetables and an increased prevalence of the same three diseases.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber has been hypothesized to lower the risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. However, little is known of the effect of dietary fiber intake on total death and cause-specific deaths.\nMETHODS: We examined dietary fiber intake in relation to total mortality and death from specific causes in the NIH (National Institutes of Health)-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort study. Diet was assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Cause of death was identified using the National Death Index Plus. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: During an average of 9 years of follow-up, we identified 20 126 deaths in men and 11 330 deaths in women. Dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly lowered risk of total death in both men and women (multivariate relative risk comparing the highest with the lowest quintile, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.82; P for trend, <.001] in men and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.85; P for trend, <.001] in women). Dietary fiber intake also lowered the risk of death from cardiovascular, infectious, and respiratory diseases by 24% to 56% in men and by 34% to 59% in women. Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and cancer death was observed in men but not in women. Dietary fiber from grains, but not from other sources, was significantly inversely related to total and cause-specific death in both men and women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber may reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular, infectious, and respiratory diseases. Making fiber-rich food choices more often may provide significant health benefits.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of whole grain and chronic disease have often included bran-enriched foods and other ingredients that do not meet the current definition of whole grains. Therefore, we assessed the literature to test whether whole grains alone had benefits on these diseases.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the contribution of bran or cereal fiber on the impact of whole grains on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and body weight measures, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human studies as the basis for establishing an American Society for Nutrition (ASN) position on this subject.\nDESIGN: We performed a comprehensive PubMed search of human studies published from 1965 to December 2010.\nRESULTS: Most whole-grain studies included mixtures of whole grains and foods with ≥25% bran. Prospective studies consistently showed a reduced risk of T2D with high intakes of cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran. For body weight, a limited number of prospective studies on cereal fiber and whole grains reported small but significant reductions in weight gain. For CVD, studies found reduced risk with high intakes of cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ASN position, based on the current state of the science, is that consumption of foods rich in cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran is modestly associated with a reduced risk of obesity, T2D, and CVD. The data for whole grains alone are limited primarily because of varying definitions among epidemiologic studies of what, and how much, was included in that food category.",

		"abstract": "The dietary pattern that characterizes the Western diet is strongly associated with obesity and related metabolic diseases, but biological mechanisms supporting these associations remain largely unknown. We argue that the Western diet promotes inflammation that arises from both structural and behavioral changes in the resident microbiome. The environment created in the gut by ultra-processed foods, a hallmark of the Western diet, is an evolutionarily unique selection ground for microbes that can promote diverse forms of inflammatory disease. Recognizing the importance of the microbiome in the development of diet-related disease has implications for future research, public dietary advice as well as food production practices. Research into food patterns suggests that whole foods are a common denominator of diets associated with a low level of diet-related disease. Hence, by studying how ultra-processing changes the properties of whole foods and how these foods affect the gut microbiome, more useful dietary guidelines can be made. Innovations in food production should be focusing on enabling health in the super-organism of man and microbe, and stronger regulation of potentially hazardous components of food products is warranted.",

These recommendations target specific subgroups of vegetables, including dry beans and peas. Dry beans and peas provide an array of nutrients and phytochemicals that have been shown to have beneficial health effects, yet consumption levels in the United States are quite low. Few studies have examined the influence of legume consumption on nutrient intakes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess nutrient and food group intakes of dry bean and pea consumers compared to nonconsumers. Dietary intake data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for adults aged ≥19 years was used. Results show that on any given day only 7.9% of adults are consuming dry beans and peas; Mexican Americans or other Hispanics are more likely to be consumers than nonconsumers. Consuming approximately ½ c dry beans or peas resulted in higher intakes of fiber, protein, folate, zinc, iron, and magnesium with lower intakes of saturated fat and total fat. These data support the specific recommendation for dry beans and peas as part of the overall vegetable recommendation. Increased consumption of dry beans and peas—economical and nutrient-rich foods—could improve the diet quality of Americans.",

		"abstract": "A comprehensive dietary fiber (DF) definition was adopted by the CODEX Alimentarius Commission (CAC) (1) to reflect the current state of knowledge about DF, (2) to recognize that all substances that behave like fiber regardless of how they are produced can be named as DF if they show physiological benefits, and (3) to promote international harmonization for food labeling and food composition tables. This review gives the history and evolution of the state of DF knowledge as looked at by refinements in DF methods and definitions subsequent to the launch of the DF hypothesis. The refinements parallel both interventional and epidemiological research leading to better understanding of the role of DF in contributing to the numerous physiological benefits imparted by all the various digestion resistant carbohydrates. A comparison of the CODEX definition (including its footnote that authorizes the inclusion of polymers with DP 3-9) and approved CODEX Type 1 methods with other existing definitions and methods will point out differences and emphasize the importance of adoption of CODEX-aligned definitions by all jurisdictions. Such harmonization enables comparison of nutrition research, recommendations, food composition tables and nutrition labels the world over. A case will be made that fibers are analogous to vitamins, in that they vary in structure, function and amount needed, but each when present in the right amount contributes to optimal health. Since the intake of DF is significantly below recommended levels throughout the world, the recognition that 'all fibers fit' is an important strategy in bridging the 'fiber gap' by enfranchising and encouraging greater intake of foods with inherent and added DF. Fortifying foods with added DF makes it easier to increase intakes while maintaining calories at recommended levels.",

		"abstract": "Fiber continues to be singled out as a nutrient of public health concern. Adequate intakes of fiber are associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, certain gastrointestinal disorders and obesity. Despite ongoing efforts to promote adequate fiber through increased vegetable, fruit and whole-grain intakes, average fiber consumption has remained flat at approximately half of the recommended daily amounts. Research indicates that consumers report increasingly attempting to add fiber-containing foods, but there is confusion around fiber in whole grains. The persistent and alarmingly low intakes of fiber prompted the \"Food &amp; Fiber Summit,\" which assembled nutrition researchers, educators and communicators to explore fiber's role in public health, current fiber consumption trends and consumer awareness data with the objective of generating opportunities and solutions to help close the fiber gap. The summit outcomes highlight the need to address consumer confusion and improve the understanding of sources of fiber, to recognize the benefits of various types of fibers and to influence future dietary guidance to provide prominence and clarity around meeting daily fiber recommendations through a variety of foods and fiber types. Potential opportunities to increase fiber intake were identified, with emphasis on meal occasions and food categories that offer practical solutions for closing the fiber gap.",

		"abstract": "One-third of adults are now obese, and children's obesity rates have climbed from 5 to 17 percent in the past 30 years. The causes of the nation's obesity epidemic are multi-factorial, having much more to do with the absence of sidewalks and the limited availability of healthy and affordable foods than a lack of personal responsibility. The broad societal changes that are needed to prevent obesity will inevitably affect activity and eating environments and settings for all ages. Many aspects of the obesity problem have been identified and discussed; however, there has not been complete agreement on what needs to be done to accelerate progress. Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention reviews previous studies and their recommendations and presents five key recommendations to accelerate meaningful change on a societal level during the next decade. The report suggests recommendations and strategies that, independently, can accelerate progress, but urges a systems approach of many strategies working in concert to maximize progress in accelerating obesity prevention. The recommendations in Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention include major reforms in access to and opportunities for physical activity; widespread reductions in the availability of unhealthy foods and beverages and increases in access to healthier options at affordable, competitive prices; an overhaul of the messages that surround Americans through marketing and education with respect to physical activity and food consumption; expansion of the obesity prevention support structure provided by health care providers, insurers, and employers; and schools as a major national focal point for obesity prevention. The report calls on all individuals, organizations, agencies, and sectors that do or can influence physical activity and nutrition environments to assess and begin to act on their potential roles as leaders in obesity prevention.",

		"abstract": "Legume food crops can contribute to the solution of diet-related public health challenges. The rich diversity of the botanical family Fabaceae (Leguminosae) allows legumes to fill numerous nutritional niches. Pulses (i.e., a subgroup of legumes including chickpeas, cowpeas, dry beans, dry peas, and lentils) are a nutrient-dense food that could play a key role in eliminating the dramatic underconsumption of dietary fiber and potassium, two dietary components of public health concern, all while maintaining a caloric intake that promotes a healthy weight status. However, incorrect use of terminology—in the commercial and scientific literature as well as in publications and materials prepared for the consuming public—creates confusion and represents a barrier to dissemination of clear dietary guideline messaging. The use of accurate terminology and a simple classification scheme can promote public health through differentiation among types of legumes, better informing the development and implementation of nutritional policies and allowing health care professionals and the public to capitalize on the health benefits associated with different legumes. Although inconsistent grouping of legumes exists across countries, the recently released 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) were chosen to illustrate potential challenges faced and areas for clarification. In the 2020–2025 DGA, pulses are included in two food groups: the protein food group and ‘beans, peas, lentils’ vegetable subgroup. To evaluate the potential of pulses to contribute to intake of key dietary components within calorie recommendations, we compared 100 kilocalorie edible portions of pulses versus other foods. These comparisons demonstrate the unique nutritional profile of pulses and the opportunity afforded by this type of legume to address public health concerns, which can be greatly advanced by reducing confusion through global harmonization of terminology.",

		"abstract": "Public health concerns are discussed so frequently that it is beginning to cause desensitization. And yet, rates of chronic disease remain alarmingly high worldwide—or are even increasing. Primary prevention is essential to reverse these trends. Indeed, the sustainable implementation of good health practices can promote human physical and psychological well-being while simultaneously being more cost-effective than the treatment of chronic disease. A healthy dietary pattern is a cornerstone of primary prevention. Pulses, or the dry seeds of non-oilseed legumes (e.g., chickpeas, cowpeas, dry beans, dry peas, and lentils)—also called grain legumes—are widely recognized as a nutrient-dense food and one of the richest sources of dietary fiber and plant protein. Combined with their affordable price point and contributions to sustainable food systems, they can be considered a prime example of a superfood. Historically, they also have a rich culinary history around the world, making them culturally relevant to many cuisines and cultures. The scientific literature supports the role of pulses in many health benefits, yet the quality of the evidence is often low. In this review, we explore the findings—and limitations—of research to date and conclude with suggestions for moving the field forward to investigate and establish robust support for a recommended serving size that is most beneficial for human health.",

In addition, pulses are affordable and shelf-stable. The combination of these factors, an elevated consumer interest in plant-based diets, and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased purchasing of pulses and even empty grocery store shelves. Although pulses have many associated benefits, some consumers are hesitant to regularly eat pulses, claiming concerns of abdominal discomfort or a lack of knowledge on how to best prepare pulses. To capitalize on increased consumer interest and purchasing of pulses, now is the time for outreach efforts that address these concerns and the positive outcomes associated with pulses, thereby promoting public and environmental health. Consumers must actively decide to add pulses to their grocery lists and incorporate them into their regular eating patterns. Motivation to adopt new eating habits is essential because knowledge alone does not result in behavior change. Thus, to mitigate perceived barriers and drive consumption, we suggest application of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model and emphasis of three main benefits of pulses as motivators: (1) culinary versatility, (2) sustainability, and (3) healthfulness.",

These recommendations target specific subgroups of vegetables, including dry beans and peas. Dry beans and peas provide an array of nutrients and phytochemicals that have been shown to have beneficial health effects, yet consumption levels in the United States are quite low. Few studies have examined the influence of legume consumption on nutrient intakes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess nutrient and food group intakes of dry bean and pea consumers compared to nonconsumers. Dietary intake data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for adults aged > or =19 years was used. Results show that on any given day only 7.9% of adults are consuming dry beans and peas; Mexican Americans or other Hispanics are more likely to be consumers than nonconsumers. Consuming approximately (1/2) c dry beans or peas resulted in higher intakes of fiber, protein, folate, zinc, iron, and magnesium with lower intakes of saturated fat and total fat. These data support the specific recommendation for dry beans and peas as part of the overall vegetable recommendation. Increased consumption of dry beans and peas-economical and nutrient-rich foods-could improve the diet quality of Americans.",

To examine the prevalence and the effect of pulse consumption on nutrient intake in Canadian adults ( ≥ 19 years), we analysed cross-sectional data (n 20,156) from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2·2. Participants were divided into non-consumers and quartiles of pulse intake. Sample weights were applied and logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association of nutrient intakes and pulse consumption, with cultural background, sex, age and economic status included as covariates. On any given day, 13 % of Canadians consume pulses, with the highest consumption in the Asian population. The pulse intake of consumers in the highest quartile was 294 (se 40) g/d and, compared with non-consumers, these individuals had higher intakes of carbohydrate, fibre and protein. As well, the micronutrient intake of pulse consumers was enhanced, resulting in fewer individuals who were below the estimated average requirement for thiamin, vitamin B6, folate, Fe, Mg, P and Zn, compared with non-consumers. Although pulses are generally low in Na, its intake also was higher in pulse consumers. Among the higher quartiles of pulse consumers, fruit and vegetable intake was one serving higher. These data indicate that pulse consumption supports dietary advice that pulses be included in healthful diets. Further studies elucidating the sources of increased Na in pulse consumers will be necessary so that dietary advice to increase consumption of pulses will maximise their nutritional benefits.",

NHANES 2003–2014 data for respondents (≥19 years) with 2 days of intake was used to evaluate trends in pulse intake. Pulse consumers were identified as those NHANES respondents who consumed pulses on one or both days. Differences in energy adjusted nutrient intakes between non-consumers and consumers were assessed. There were no significant trends in pulse intakes for the total population or for pulse consumers over the 10-year period. In 2013–2014, approximately 27% of adults consumed pulses with an intake of 70.9 ± 2.5 g/day over 2 days, just slightly <0.5 cup equivalents/day. At all levels of consumption, consumers had higher (p < 0.01) energy adjusted intakes of fiber, folate, magnesium. Higher energy adjusted intakes for potassium, zinc, iron and choline and lower intakes of fat were observed for consumers than for non-consumers at intakes ≥69.4 ± 1.01 g/day. These data suggest that pulse consumption in the US population may result in better diet quality with diets that are more nutrient dense than those without pulses.",

		"abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND: As a first step towards genetic improvement of seed quality in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), seven desi and nine kabuli varieties were grown at multiple sites to assess the affect of environment on seed yield, weight and selected seed constituents. The sites were chosen to represent a range of environments in chickpea production areas of the Canadian prairies. RESULTS: Genotype ? environment interaction effects on starch, amylose and protein (desi only) concentrations and seed yield were significant, suggesting that the varieties did not perform consistently relative to each other in the different environments. Starch concentration was negatively correlated (rkabuli = ?0.25, P < 0.05; rdesi = ?0.16, P < 0.05) with protein concentration in both chickpea market classes. However, repeatability estimates of starch, amylose and protein concentrations were low and inconsistent across chickpea market classes, possibly owing to complex biosynthetic pathways for these constituents. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that testing for seed constituent traits over a range of environments will be required to improve seed quality in individual chickpea varieties. The best selection strategies for seed constituent improvement in chickpea will be influenced by genotype and genotype ? environment interaction for these traits. The negative relationship between seed constituents and yield indicates that selection for chickpea cultivars with desired seed composition may require compromise and indirect selection.

		"abstract": "Landraces are a valuable source of genetic variability for breeders to develop high-yielding lentil varieties. Apart from productivity, simultaneous breeding for lentil seed nutritional quality is of paramount importance for wider lentil consumption. This work examined the indirect effect of single plant selection for high yield on important seed quality traits within three Greek lentil landraces (“Elassona” (EL), “Lefkada” (L), and “Evros” (EV)). The breeding methodology applied was proved to help either maintain or improve such characteristics in the high-yielding second-cycle lines (SLs) selected. Compared to the parental landrace “Elassona”, the high-yielding lines showed increased crude fiber by 30–110%; the line 2-SL-EL-6 had higher starch content by 3.9% and reduced cooking time by 6.67 min, while the 2-SL-EL-10 line had higher crude fiber by 73%. In the case of “Lefkada”, the high-yielding lines selected maintained the protein content present in the parental landrace, apart from the 2-SL-L-1 where a decrease by 5% was recorded; however, most of them showed increased crude fiber (5.59–7.52%) in comparison with the parental landrace (4.65%). Finally, in relation to the “Evros” parental landrace, the 2-SL-EV-3 and 2-SL-EV-4 showed higher crude fiber and reduced cooking time. This study provides evidence that proper management of genetic variability could improve productivity without compromising or sometimes improving some seed quality traits.",

NIR calibrations were developed using 165 samples of field peas and 151 samples of chickpeas which had been spectrally selected from larger populations encompassing two seasons. For both species, calibration accuracy was generally better on ground than whole samples for chemical composition, but better on whole than ground samples for physical or functional properties. For most properties measured, accuracy of NIR calibrations was either satisfactory or promising, but successful implementation in a breeding programme will depend on further evaluation using independent samples, broadening the sample populations or improvements in the reference methods.",

		"abstract": "Sustainable agroecosystems provide adequate food while supporting environmental and human wellbeing and are a key part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some strategies to promote sustainability include reducing inputs, substituting conventional crops with genetically modified (GM) alternatives, and using organic production. Here, we leveraged global databases covering 121 countries to determine which farming strategies—the amount of inputs per area (fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation), GM crops, and percent agriculture in organic production—are most correlated with 12 sustainability metrics recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Using quantile regression, we found that countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, countries with more GM crops were last on track to meeting the SDG of reduced inequalities. Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004–2018, we found that countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa. Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a lesser extent, intensive use of inputs.",

		"abstract": "Perennial crops have numerous ecological and agronomic advantages over their annual counterparts. We estimate discrete choice models to evaluate farmers' preferences for perennial attributes of pigeon pea intercropped with maize in central and southern Malawi. Pigeon pea is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous crop, which has the potential to ameliorate soil fertility problems related to continuous maize cultivation, which are common in Southern Africa. Adoption of annual pigeon pea is relatively low but perennial production of pigeon pea may be more appealing to farmers due to some of the ancillary benefits associated with perenniality. We model perennial production of pigeon pea as a function of the attributes that differ between annual and perennial production: lower labor and seed requirements resulting from a single planting with multiple harvests, enhanced soil fertility and higher levels of biomass production. The primary tradeoff associated with perennial pigeon pea intercropped with maize is competition with maize in subsequent years of production. While maize yield is approximately twice as valuable to farmers as pigeon pea yield, we find positive yet heterogeneous demand for perenniality driven by soil fertility improvements and pigeon pea grain yield.",

		"abstract": "A field experiment including 3 sainfoin cultivars (Makedonka, EG Norm, and the Sokobanja population) was set up in a seed production trial with the aim of determining adequate row spacing for seed and forage yield. The cultivars were sown at 3 different row spacings (20 cm, 50 cm, and 80 cm) and at a within-row spacing of 1 cm. Seed yield was determined over a 3-year period, whereas forage yield and quality were evaluated from the 2nd cut in the 2nd and 3rd years. Crop thinning through the years, distinct competitive ability of sainfoin, and a large impact of weather conditions induced significant differences in seed yield among years. All cultivars gave considerably higher yields at wider row spacings in the 2nd and 3rd years of the experiment. The cultivars responded differently to variable row spacings across years, which was due to differences in seed yield performance under different growing spaces and available moisture conditions. Owing to the low profitability of seed yield, in respect of both seed and forage yield, the use of wider row spacings (about 50 cm) for vigorous cultivars and narrower row spacing (below 50 cm) for less vigorous cultivars for seed yield may become feasible.",

		"abstract": "Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) is a perennial forage legume that has received renewed interest in western Canada because of its desirable forage characteristics. The objective of this review is to summarize previous studies on the agronomy, forage yield, nutritive value, seed characteristics, and diseases and pests of sainfoin. In addition, the review also focuses on the genetic diversity and registered cultivars of sainfoin and their potential use in temperate grasslands. Past studies have reported that sainfoin has a high nutritive value, and high voluntary intake and palatability to grazing animals. In western Canada, dry matter (DM) yield of sainfoin is 80%–95% that of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Unlike other legumes such as alfalfa, sainfoin does not cause bloat in grazing animals due to the presence of condensed tannins. Sainfoin is suitable for monoculture or binary mixtures with either grasses or alfalfa. Genetic diversity studies revealed that sainfoin germplasm generally has high variation within populations. Genetic variation among plants provides an opportunity to develop improved cultivars with desirable characteristics. However, compared with the other forage legumes, sainfoin is still an underdeveloped forage crop with few cultivars being available in western Canada. New sainfoin cultivars with high DM yield and persistence under regional growing conditions are required.",

		"abstract": "The density and efficiency of bumble bees, honey bees, and alfalfa leafcutter bees on sainfoin, Onobrychis viciaefolia Scop., grown in southern Alberta were studied. Six species of bees were identified as pollinators, with alfalfa leafcutter bees comprising 56% of the observations, honey bees 40%, and bumble bees 4%. The density of flowers over the season can be described as curvilinear. The mean number of flowers per raceme decreased significantly over the season. The rate of foraging by pollinator species from flower to flower varied and is described by multiple regression models. Julian date, hour of day, and flower density are the independent variables. More than 90% of the bees visited three or fewer flowers per raceme when 60% of the racemes had three or more flowers available for pollination. The bees foraged on sainfoin for about 12 h per day and average bee density increased significantly with the corresponding flower density. A theoretical approach used to predict the bee populations required to pollinate varying flower densities shows that the required population of bumble bees is about two-thirds that of honey bees or alfalfa leafcutter bees. The observed populations of pollinators did not correspond well with the derived values, probably because multiple visits per flower are required for fertilization., Les auteurs ont étudié la densité et l’efficacité des bourdons, des abeilles domestiques et des mégachiles de la luzerne sur le sainfoin, Onobrychis viciaefolia Scop., cultivé dans le sud de l’Alberta. Parmi les insectes pollinisateurs de cette culture, ils ont observé six espèces d’apidés dont les trois susmentionées, dans les proportions 4%, 40% et 56%. Au cours de la saison de végétation, la densité des fleurs varie suivant une courbe curvilinéaire, et le nombre moyen de fleurs par grappe diminue de façon significative. Le taux de butinage varie selon les espèces pollinisatrices et est représentée par des modèles de régression multiples. La date du calendrier julien, l’heure du jour et la densité des fleurs sont les variables indépendantes. Plus de 90% des apidés à l’étude ont visité trois fleurs ou moins par grappe lorsque 60% des grappes comptaient au moins trois fleurs prêtes à être pollinisées. Les espèces observées passaient environ 12 h chaque jour à butiner dans le sainfoin, et leur densité moyenne a augmenté de façon significative en fonction de la densité des fleurs. L’approche théorique utilisée pour prévoir le nombre de sujets de chaque espèce nécessaire pour polliniser différentes densités de fleurs révèle que la population de bourdons requise à cette fin n’équivaut qu’au deux tiers environ du nombre d’abeilles domestiques ou de mégachiles de la luzerne. Le nombre de pollinisateurs de chaque espèce observé ne concorde pas avec les valeurs obtenues, et cela probablement parce que plusieurs visites d’une même fleur sont nécessaires pour assurer la fécondation.",

		"abstract": "Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) is a highly palatable perennial forage legume that is gaining renewed interest in western Canada since it does not cause frothy bloat in grazing ruminants. It is adapted to western Canadian growing conditions and yields similar to other forage legumes, but slightly less than alfalfa. Despite its nutritional and environmental benefits, sainfoin use in western Canada is limited due to agronomic restrictions compared to alfalfa, and high seed cost. This three-year research study evaluated two sainfoin cultivars, Melrose and AAC Mountainview, as monocultures and in mixtures with three grass species, crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L.) cv. AC Goliath, meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.) cv. Armada, and hybrid bromegrass (Bromus riparius x Bromus inermis) cv. AC Knowles, under different harvest regimes to assess reduced seeding rate of sainfoin and determine agronomic performance of sainfoin-grass mixtures in different soil zones. A common industry mixture, Beaver alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-Armada meadow bromegrass was included for comparison. The sainfoin-grass mixtures compared favorably to the common mixture, with acceptable winter survival, forage yields, species compatibility, and nutritive value for use in the western Canadian beef industry. Melrose in mixtures with crested wheatgrass cv. AC Goliath at a 30:70 seeding rate performed well in the Dark Brown soil zone. Melrose or AAC Mountainview in mixtures with crested wheatgrass cv. AC Goliath at a 30:70 seeding rate performed well in the Black soil zone. Melrose or AAC Mountainview in mixtures with crested wheatgrass cv. AC Goliath at the 50:50 seeding rate performed well in the Brown soil zone. Melrose and AAC Mountainview in mixtures with crested wheatgrass at the 70:30 seeding ratio often had the greatest nutritional quality. However, the nutritional value of all the sainfoin-grass mixtures was similar within each experimental site. To reduce seed cost, seeding rate of sainfoin monocultures could be reduced by at least 50% while maintaining forage yields. Melrose at 50% of the current recommended seeding rate performed well in the Dark Brown soil zone, Melrose or AAC Mountainview at 25% of the current recommended seeding performed well in the Black soil zone, and Melrose or AAC Mountainview at 50% of the current recommended seeding rate performed well in the Brown soil zone. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used to successfully predict legume proportion and crude protein in sainfoin-grass mixtures with high accuracy. Calibration equations developed for neutral detergent fiber predictions had medium to high accuracy, but poor accuracy for acid detergent fiber predictions.",

		"abstract": "Modern intensive monocropping system is becoming unproductive, pest ridden, loss incurring, and resource depleting and hence turning out to be untenable. Lack of discrimination in input use by farm managers and overall poor management are accelerating degradation and desertification processes, and loss of biodiversity particularly add in endangered regions. While, properly designed diverse and strategically located tree/seasonal crop based land use systems can contribute to ecologic services by mitigation land degradation, climate change and desertification, while conserving natural resources and biodiversity. Besides providing, diverse goods and services, on-farm diversity can be considered as an adoptive strategy in areas climatically and biologically vulnerable. Being a potential C sink, tree based land use systems can also mitigate negative impacts of CO2 emission. As green belt/bank these have an important role in maintaining air, water and soil quality in mining and industrial areas. The so-called cellulosic feedstocks can be grown on marginal land, enhance soil fertility by promoting the growth of various soil organisms, and provide a climate- friendly source of energy. There are plenty of underexploited but potential plant species which can find niche in the existing agroecosystems with substantial addition to total production while contributing sufficiently to ecological services. These needs to be identified and useful models are developed for specific situations.",

		"abstract": "Wild and managed bees are key pollinators, ensuring or enhancing the reproduction of a large fraction of the world's wild flowering plants and the yield of ∼85% of all cultivated crops. Recent reports of wild bee decline and its potential consequences are thus worrisome. However, evidence is mostly based on local or regional studies; the global status of bee decline has not been assessed yet. To fill this gap, we analyzed publicly available worldwide occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility spanning over a century. We found that after the 1990s, the number of collected bee species declines steeply such that approximately 25% fewer species were reported between 2006 and 2015 than before the 1990s. Although these trends must be interpreted cautiously given the heterogeneous nature of the dataset and potential biases in data collection and reporting, results suggest the need for swift actions to avoid further pollinator decline.",

		"abstract": "Four popular West African local cultivars of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), with distinctly different seed coat colors, were evaluated for their relative amylograph pasting characteristics, condensed tannin content, in vitro protein digestibility and Tetrahymena protein efficiency ratio (t-PER). The effects of roasting and dehulling on these properties were also determined. There were wide variations in the hot paste viscosity characteristics of the different cultivars studied. The raw cowpea flour samples exhibited maximum paste viscosities ranging between 260 Brabender Units (BU) for the Mottled cultivar and 460 BU for the cream-colored Blackeye cultivar. Cowpea cultivars with the greatest peak viscosities showed low stabilities to extended cooking. Roasting depressed paste viscosity properties of all the cowpea cultivars studied. Tannin concentrations were 0.3-6.9 and 7.2-116 mg CE/g flour from whole cowpea seeds and seed coats respectively, increasing with intensity of seed color. Although dehulling removed 98% of the tannin content of raw cowpeas, improvement in protein quality as a result of dehulling was observed for only the highly-pigmented Maroon-red variety. Roasting significantly improved digestibility and more than doubled the t-PER of all cowpea cultivars studied. Roasted cowpeas possess adequate nutritional and functional qualities as protein supplements in cereal-based weaning foods. However, it appears that dehulling is necessary to enhance the nutritional quality of the highly pigmented cultivars of cowpea.",

Hence the role of agronomic biofortification in solving hidden hunger or micronutrient malnutrition is tremendous. Biofortification of pulses through inventive agronomic interventions, viz. seed treatment (seed priming and seed coating); foliar fertilization and soil application could be a faster, easy and attractive measure to add micronutrient concentration in the human diet. Among ferti-fortification strategies, soil and foliar methods are established practices, but cost cutting and procuring high-quality micronutrient fertilizers are a major concern in developing nations. However, micronutrient application through seed coating, seed priming not only improves germination, stand establishment, plant vigour, and yield but also micronutrient concentration in the grain. Seed priming or on-farm seed priming and seed coating, being an effective way of supplying starter nutrient for seedling establishment and early growth is an attractive option for resource-poor farmers, as it is low-priced and easy strategy of nutrients enrichment. The effectiveness of ferti-fortification largely depends on crop genotype, soil type, soil fertility, cropping system, environmental factors etc. Such factors are needed to be tackled with appropriate inventive steps to ascertain increased micronutrients concentration in pulses grain parts which are commonly consumed by the vegetarian population of the world.",

Since 2003, HarvestPlus and its partners have demonstrated that this agriculture-based method of addressing micronutrient deficiency through plant breeding works. More than 20 million people in farm households in developing countries are now growing and consuming biofortified crops. This review summarizes key evidence and discusses delivery experiences, as well as farmer and consumer adoption. Given the strength of the evidence, attention should now shift to an action-oriented agenda for scaling biofortification to improve nutrition globally. To reach one billion people by 2030, there are three key challenges: 1) mainstreaming biofortified traits into public plant breeding programs; 2) building consumer demand; and 3) integrating biofortification into public and private policies, programs, and investments. While many building blocks are in place, institutional leadership is needed to continue to drive towards this ambitious goal.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber has been hypothesized to lower the risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. However, little is known of the effect of dietary fiber intake on total death and cause-specific deaths.\nMETHODS: We examined dietary fiber intake in relation to total mortality and death from specific causes in the NIH (National Institutes of Health)-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort study. Diet was assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Cause of death was identified using the National Death Index Plus. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: During an average of 9 years of follow-up, we identified 20 126 deaths in men and 11 330 deaths in women. Dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly lowered risk of total death in both men and women (multivariate relative risk comparing the highest with the lowest quintile, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.82; P for trend, <.001] in men and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.85; P for trend, <.001] in women). Dietary fiber intake also lowered the risk of death from cardiovascular, infectious, and respiratory diseases by 24% to 56% in men and by 34% to 59% in women. Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and cancer death was observed in men but not in women. Dietary fiber from grains, but not from other sources, was significantly inversely related to total and cause-specific death in both men and women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber may reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular, infectious, and respiratory diseases. Making fiber-rich food choices more often may provide significant health benefits.",

Because GBD is highly standardised and comprehensive, spanning both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, and uses a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of hierarchical disease and injury causes, the study provides a powerful basis for detailed and broad insights on global health trends and emerging challenges. GBD 2019 incorporates data from 281 586 sources and provides more than 3·5 billion estimates of health outcome and health system measures of interest for global, national, and subnational policy dialogue. All GBD estimates are publicly available and adhere to the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. From this vast amount of information, five key insights that are important for health, social, and economic development strategies have been distilled.

		"abstract": "The Onobrychis genus comprises a few agronomically important forage legume species, with sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) being the most widespread. O. viciifolia has a long history of traditional culture worldwide, but its use has declined in western countries over the last decades. It suffers from low productivity and is more difficult to maintain than other legumes but is known to have valuable characteristics such as palatability and drought tolerance. Recent studies suggest that it has several other highly beneficial properties due to its unique tannin and polyphenol composition. Condensed tannins present in Onobrychis species have been shown to confer anthelmintic properties, increase protein utilization and prevent bloating; they may also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Positive effects on wildlife and honey production could also be advantageous in the context of sustainable farming. Modern breeding programmes have not been a priority, leading to a lack of genetic knowledge in comparison to extensively used forage legumes. It is expected that potential for O. viciifolia improvements could be achieved by rigorous characterization of the available germplasm and utilization of characters derived from close relatives of the genus. Breeding priorities for the future would include enhanced germination and improved early establishment, allied to the best anthelmintic properties observed in some varieties.",

This book brings together in one volume all aspects of their basic biology and associated production practices. Emphasis is placed on the importance of understanding plant characteristics and their consequences in terms of forage output, quality and utilization by livestock. Recent research advances are reviewed and put into context and several recently commercialised species are also covered. The introduction considers the history, current extent, benefits and limits of temperate forage legume usage. Subsequent chapters are dedicated to a comprehensive examination of each forage species in turn, dealing with their origin, morphology, physiology, ecology, nitrogen-fixing capability, cultivars, seed production, nutritive value and productivity. The key factors for optimal management are identified and the prospects for the future outlined, including the potential arising from the use of biotechnology. This book is essential reading for degree and postgraduate students of plant science, agronomy and animal production. Additionally, students and researchers in ecology and environmental science will also find it a valuable resource. The management sections will be of particular value to grassland advisers, consultants and progressive land users.",

		"abstract": "This paper examines the nutritional and veterinary effects of tannins on ruminants and makes some comparisons with non-ruminants. Tannin chemistry per se is not covered and readers are referred to several excellent reviews instead: (a) Okuda T et al. Heterocycles 30:1195–1218 (1990); (b) Ferreira D and Slade D. Nat Prod Rep 19:517–541 (2002); (c) Yoshida T et al. In Studies in Natural Product Chemistry. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, pp. 395–453 (2000); (d) Khanbabaee K and van Ree T. Nat Prod Rep 18:641–649 (2001); (e) Okuda et al. Phytochemistry 55:513–529 (2000). The effects of tannins on rumen micro-organisms are also not reviewed, as these have been addressed by others: (a) McSweeney CS et al. Anim Feed Sci Technol 91:83–93 (2001); (b) Smith AH and Mackie RI. Appl Environ Microbiol 70:1104–1115 (2004). This paper deals first with the nutritional effects of tannins in animal feeds, their qualitative and quantitative diversity, and the implications of tannin–protein complexation. It then summarises the known physiological and harmful effects and discusses the equivocal evidence of the bioavailability of tannins. Issues concerning tannin metabolism and systemic effects are also considered. Opportunities are presented on how to treat feeds with high tannin contents, and some lesser-known but successful feeding strategies are highlighted. Recent research has explored the use of tannins for preventing animal deaths from bloat, for reducing intestinal parasites and for lowering gaseous ammonia and methane emissions. Finally, several tannin assays and a hypothesis are discussed that merit further investigation in order to assess their suitability for predicting animal responses. The aim is to provoke discussion and spur readers into new approaches. An attempt is made to synthesise the emerging information for relating tannin structures with their activities. Although many plants with high levels of tannins produce negative effects and require treatments, others are very useful animal feeds. Our ability to predict whether tannin-containing feeds confer positive or negative effects will depend on interdisciplinary research between animal nutritionists and plant chemists. The elucidation of tannin structure–activity relationships presents exciting opportunities for future feeding strategies that will benefit ruminants and the environment within the contexts of extensive, semi-intensive and some intensive agricultural systems.

		"abstract": "Plant phenolic compounds are diverse in structure but are characterised by hydroxylated aromatic rings (e.g. flavan-3-ols). They are categorised as secondary metabolites, and their function in plants is often poorly understood. Many plant phenolic compounds are polymerised into larger molecules such as the proanthocyanidins (PA; condensed tannins) and lignins. Only the lignins, PA, oestrogenic compounds and hydrolysable tannins will be considered here. Lignins slow the physical and microbial degradation of ingested feed, because of resilient covalent bonding with hemicellulose and cellulose, rather than any direct effects on the rumen per se. The PA are prevalent in browse and are expressed in the foliage of some legumes (e.g. Lotus spp.), but rarely in grasses. They reduce the nutritive value of poor-quality diets, but can also have substantial benefits for ruminant productivity and health when improved temperate forages are fed. Beneficial effects are dependent on the chemical and physical structure, and concentration of the PA in the diet, but they have been shown to improve live-weight gain, milk yield and protein concentration, and ovulation rate. They prevent bloat in cattle, reduce gastrointestinal nematode numbers, flystrike and CH4 production. Some phenolic compounds (e.g. coumestans) cause temporary infertility, whilst those produced by Fusarium fungi found in pasture, silage or stored grains can cause permanent infertility. The HT may be toxic because products of their metabolism can cause liver damage and other metabolic disorders.",

The phytochemical-rich forage sainfoin (\n              Onobrychis viciifolia\n              ) and purified phenolics (\n              trans\n              -cinnamic acid,\n              p\n              -coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were evaluated for their ability to reduce the viability of pathogenic\n              Escherichia coli\n              strains, including\n              E. coli\n              O157:H7. MICs were determined using purified phenolics and acetone extracts of sainfoin and alfalfa (\n              Medicago sativa\n              ), a non-tannin-containing legume. Ground sainfoin or pure phenolics were mixed with fresh cattle feces and inoculated with a ciprofloxacin-resistant strain of\n              E. coli\n              , O157:H7, to assess its viability at −20°C, 5°C, or 37°C over 14 days. Forty steers were fed either a sainfoin (hay or silage) or alfalfa (hay or silage) diet over a 9-week period. In the in vitro study, the MICs for coumaric (1.2 mg/ml) and cinnamic (1.4 mg/ml) acids were 10- to 20-fold lower than the MICs for sainfoin and alfalfa extracts. In the inoculated feces, the −20°C treatment had death rates which were at least twice as high as those of the 5°C treatment, irrespective of the additive used. Sainfoin was less effective than coumaric acid in reducing\n              E. coli\n              O157:H7 Cip\n              r\n              in the inoculated feces. During the animal trial, fecal\n              E. coli\n              numbers declined marginally in the presence of sainfoin (silage and hay) and alfalfa silage but not in the presence of hay, indicating the presence of other phenolics in alfalfa. In conclusion, phenolic-containing forages can be used as a means of minimally reducing\n              E. coli\n              shedding in cattle without affecting animal production.",

		"abstract": "The natural systems agriculture (NSA) idea was developed at The Land Institute in 1977 and was published in 1978. Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essentials for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature’s ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans can now build an agriculture based on nature’s ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture.",

In contrast, monocultures of annual crops are sown on more than two-thirds of global cropland. Grain and oilseed crops are the foundation of the human diet, but to date there are no perennial species that produce adequate grain harvests. Yet perennial plant communities store more carbon, maintain better soil and water quality, and manage nutrients more conservatively than do annual plant communities, and they have greater biomass and resource management capacity. These advantages provide a base from which to begin hybridization and selection for increased resource allocation to developing seeds, a decades-long process that must overcome or circumvent genetic complications.

		"abstract": "Annual cereal and legume grain production is dependent on inorganic nitrogen (N) and other fertilizers inputs to resupply nutrients lost as harvested grain, via soil erosion/runoff, and by other natural or anthropogenic causes. Temperate-adapted perennial grain legumes, though currently non-existent, might be uniquely situated as crop plants able to provide relief from reliance on synthetic nitrogen while supplying stable yields of highly nutritious seeds in low-input agricultural ecosystems. As such, perennial grain legume breeding and domestication programs are being initiated at The Land Institute (Salina, KS, USA) and elsewhere. This review aims to facilitate the development of those programs by providing criteria for evaluating potential species and in choosing candidates most likely to be domesticated and adopted as herbaceous, perennial, temperate-adapted grain legumes. We outline specific morphological and ecophysiological traits that may influence each candidate’s agronomic potential, the quality of its seeds and the ecosystem services it can provide. Finally, we suggest that perennial grain legume breeders and domesticators should consider how a candidate’s reproductive biology, genome structure and availability of genetic resources will determine its ease of breeding and its domestication timeline.",

		"abstract": "Legume grains are important sources of nutrients in human and animal diets and have been so for millennia. Their history as part of traditional diets dates to the origins of agriculture when their benefits for soil health and agricultural productivity started to be realized, mostly empirically, by farmers. In time, legumes have lost their popularity as human food, either because of a negative connotation as “poor man's meat,” occasional gastrointestinal side effects, or habitually longer preparation times when compared to other types of plant foods. Also, the steep rise in the consumption of meat derived foods in the last half of a century has taken a toll on replacing legumes as a major protein source. Alongside this negative trend in consumption, a negative drift in production was also observed, especially in Europe, where legumes currently occupy a minimal fraction of agricultural land. One of the main factors is a loss in competitive edge amongst farmers due to sustained lower public and private investments in breeding programs and legume adapted technology for planting, managing, harvesting, processing, and storing, when compared to cereals. Recently, increased awareness of the need to move to sustainable food systems is revitalizing legume production and consumption in Europe, leading to a compilation of policies and initiatives that aim to put legumes again as foundations for this transition. Legumes have been reinvented in a multitude of products (drinks, cereal bars, bread, meat replacers, snacks, flours, and several others) and included in farming systems of conservation agriculture, organic production, intercropping, and crop rotation, combining ancient traditions of legume production “with a spin,” incorporating new legume technological knowledge in farming systems. However, the transition has been slow and hampered by many cultural, societal, political, and economic impediments. This paper summarizes initiatives that aim to enable the comeback of legumes and their placement in a more prominent position in human diets and agricultural fields and highlights strategies that aim at overcoming the obstacles that impede achieving the development of more sustainable agri-food systems and sustainable diets in Europe.",

		"abstract": "The United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared 2015 the International Year of\nSoils (IYS) and 2016 the International Year of Pulses (IYP) to increase awareness and\nunderstanding on the importance of soils and pulses respectively for sustainable food\nproduction, food and nutrition security and essential ecosystem functions. In order\nto ensure due complementarities, close links have been maintained between these\ntwo celebratory events, taking account of the symbiosis between soil and pulses for\ncontributing to food security and nutrition, and the achievement of the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). The development of this book started with the Seminar\n“Soils and pulses: symbiosis for life. A contribution to the 2030 Agenda” held in April\n2016, jointly organized by the Permanent Representation of Italy to FAO, FAO and\nBiodiversity International.\nSoils provide a range of ecosystem services that are fundamental to human wellbeing\nand life on Earth, but in spite of their crucial role, soils have been taken for\ngranted for a long time. Population growth and associated changes in consumption\npatterns and diet are putting increasing pressure on soil resources, creating the need\nto grow more food on smaller units of land and to do so using less water. As a result,\npressures on soil resources are reaching critical limits and soils are being continuously\ndegraded (roughly 33 % of global land is already degraded). There is thus an urgent\nneed to raise awareness on the importance of this strategic resource and to promote\nits sustainable management. Careful soil management can increase the food supply,\nproviding a valuable lever for climate regulation and a pathway for safeguarding\necosystem services. Additionally, large economic benefits will be generated from\nthe sustainable management of soil resources. According to the revised World Soil\nCharter: “soil management is sustainable if the supporting, provisioning, regulating,\nand cultural services provided by soil are maintained or enhanced without significantly\nimpairing the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity”.\nEqually, despite the importance of pulses (generally defined as “the edible seeds of\nvarious leguminous crops” and mostly referring to legumes harvested for dry grain) in\ncontributing to food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture, they are not\nwell known to most. Pulses can be strategic allies in maintaining and increasing soil\nhealth, restoring degraded soils and improving overall human wellbeing. Farmers have\nknown since the beginning of agriculture that legumes are important for soil health\nand agricultural techniques such as intercropping and crop rotation have been used\nfor millennia. Pulses should therefore not only be planted for their immediate returns\nof high yields, but also because they will enrich the soils for subsequent crops. Pulses\n(and legumes in general) improve soil health due to the symbiotic presence of various\nsoil bacteria (collectively called rhizobia) in the legume roots. As a result, pulses are\nresponsible for the biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and for the solubilisation of phosphate ions from bound forms such as calcium and iron phosphates to make\nthese nutrients available to plants. Besides their role in the nitrogen and phosphorous\ncycles, pulses also contribute to increasing soil organic matter, improving soil structure\nand maintaining soil biodiversity, leading to overall increased soil health.\nBy fixing atmospheric nitrogen and solubilizing phosphates, pulses contribute\nto reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and, in doing so, greatly contribute to\nreducing the risk of soil and water pollution, supporting soil biodiversity, and combating\nand building resilience to climate change. Biological nitrogen fixation is particularly\nimportant for global agricultural productivity and might be considered one of the\nmost important biological processes on the planet. It provides circa 100 million metric\ntonnes of N which leads to an annual saving of around USD10 billion in N fertilizer.\nLentils alone could fix nitrogen in the range of 35-100 kg ha-1. Furthermore, the reduced\nneed for (or use of) synthetic fertilizers indirectly reduces the amount of greenhouse\ngases released into the atmosphere. Pulses also promote soil carbon sequestration\nand, ultimately, reduce soil erosion when included in intercropping farming systems\nand/or used as cover crops. Furthermore, due to their high nutritional value, pulses are\nalso valuable allies in fighting hunger worldwide.\nThe symbiosis between soil and pulses is ultimately expressed in the cropping system.\nThe inclusion of pulses in multiple cropping systems such as intercropping or in simple\ncrop rotations is indeed considered important for the integrated management of the\nsoil nutrients and for moving towards conservation and organic agriculture. In turn,\nthis is of critical importance considering the need for intensifying food production\nwhile making better use of input resources and building resilience to climate change.\nIn summary, pulses are important food crops that can play a major role in addressing\nfuture global food security and environmental challenges, as well as in contributing to\nhealthy diets. Pulses contain on average 19-25 percent protein, with over 30 percent in\nnewly developed varieties. Due to their high nutritional value, pulses can improve the\ndiet of the poorest who cannot rely on a diversified diet enriched by meat consumption.\nNearly 80 percent of dietary protein in the developing world is plant protein, compared\nto 43.4 percent in developed countries where animal protein is mostly consumed.\nThis publication aims to provide an overview to decision makers and practitioners of\nthe main scientific facts, information and technical recommendations regarding the\nsymbiosis between soils and pulses. It highlights how good practices may be put in\nplace to support ending hunger and malnutrition, adapting to climate change, halting\nland degradation and achieving overall sustainable development.",

		"abstract": "Biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a natural process of significant importance in world agriculture. The demand for accurate determinations of global inputs of biologically-fixed nitrogen (N) is strong and will continue to be fuelled by the need to understand and effectively manage the global N cycle. In this paper we review and update long-standing and more recent estimates of biological N2 fixation for the different agricultural systems, including the extensive, uncultivated tropical savannas used for grazing. Our methodology was to combine data on the areas and yields of legumes and cereals from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) database on world agricultural production (FAOSTAT) with published and unpublished data on N2 fixation. As the FAO lists grain legumes only, and not forage, fodder and green manure legumes, other literature was accessed to obtain approximate estimates in these cases. Below-ground plant N was factored into the estimations. The most important N2-fixing agents in agricultural systems are the symbiotic associations between crop and forage/fodder legumes and rhizobia. Annual inputs of fixed N are calculated to be 2.95 Tg for the pulses and 18.5 Tg for the oilseed legumes. Soybean (Glycine max) is the dominant crop legume, representing 50% of the global crop legume area and 68% of global production. We calculate soybean to fix 16.4 Tg N annually, representing 77% of the N fixed by the crop legumes. Annual N2 fixation by soybean in the U.S., Brazil and Argentina is calculated at 5.7, 4.6 and 3.4 Tg, respectively. Accurately estimating global N2 fixation for the symbioses of the forage and fodder legumes is challenging because statistics on the areas and productivity of these legumes are almost impossible to obtain. The uncertainty increases as we move to the other agricultural-production systems—rice (Oryza sativa), sugar cane (Saccharum spp.), cereal and oilseed (non-legume) crop lands and extensive, grazed savannas. Nonetheless, the estimates of annual N2 fixation inputs are 12–25 Tg (pasture and fodder legumes), 5 Tg (rice), 0.5 Tg (sugar cane), <4 Tg (non-legume crop lands) and <14 Tg (extensive savannas). Aggregating these individual estimates provides an overall estimate of 50–70 Tg N fixed biologically in agricultural systems. The uncertainty of this range would be reduced with the publication of more accurate statistics on areas and productivity of forage and fodder legumes and the publication of many more estimates of N2 fixation, particularly in the cereal, oilseed and non-legume crop lands and extensive tropical savannas used for grazing.",

		"abstract": "Data collated from around the world indicate that, for every tonne of shoot dry matter produced by crop legumes, the symbiotic relationship with rhizobia is responsible for fixing, on average on a whole plant basis (shoots and nodulated roots), the equivalent of 30–40 kg of nitrogen (N). Consequently, factors that directly influence legume growth (e.g. water and nutrient availability, disease incidence and pests) tend to be the main determinants of the amounts of N2 fixed. However, practices that either limit the presence of effective rhizobia in the soil (no inoculation, poor inoculant quality), increase soil concentrations of nitrate (excessive tillage, extended fallows, fertilizer N), or enhance competition for soil mineral N (intercropping legumes with cereals) can also be critical. Much of the N2 fixed by the legume is usually removed at harvest in high-protein seed so that the net residual contributions of fixed N to agricultural soils after the harvest of legumegrain may be relatively small.Nonetheless, the inclusion of legumes in a cropping sequence generally improves the productivity of following crops. Whilesome of these rotational effects may be associated with improvements in availability of N in soils, factors unrelated to N also play an important role. Recent results suggest that one such non-N benefit may be due to the impact on soil biology of hydrogenemitted from nodules as a by-product of N2, fixation.",

		"abstract": "Grain-legume plants fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and thus do not need nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, grain-legumes can potentially decrease global warming, as nitrogen fertilization is responsible for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, grain-legumes have many functional and nutritional properties both as feed and food. Despite the fact that the European Union has granted considerable subsidies to promote grain-legume cultivation, their production continues to fall and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why. This study provides an answer by showing that a situation of technological lock-in has resulted from the co-evolution of crop systems, based on an agrochemical paradigm, public policies, and market dynamics that promote cereals. This process began with the historical choice by European and French public institutions to relegate grain-legumes to feed in direct competition with imported soybeans. Moreover, interrelated factors, such as breeding selection, public subsidies, and food systems, have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of grain-legumes. Finally, the evolutionary economics approach used here identified several actions that must be implemented together, such as agricultural cost-accounting methods, nitrogen management, institutional innovations, and market outlets to promote grain-legumes and move towards more sustainable agriculture.",

		"abstract": "Crop diversification can improve the sustainability of Western agriculture. In particular, pulses are crops that can help both agriculture and the food industry become more ecological, as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help reduce animal-based consumption. Today, however, the development of these crops in Europe has been hindered due to lock-in, since major crops have been co-developed to a greater extent in farming and food systems. After briefly reviewing the major mechanisms that lead to this lock-in, this article adopts a co-evolution framework to address the interconnected transition of agriculture and food systems. We explore how current societal trends in the agrifood system offer new opportunities for pulses, and how simultaneous changes both in production and consumption can facilitate this dual transition. Drawing on insights from the literature and interviews with stakeholders in France—taken here as examples—we argue that to develop pulses, strong support is required from public institutions to coordinate and guide the multiple actors involved in the same direction.",

		"abstract": "Background and objectives More than 2 billion people suffer with malnutrition arising from dietary protein and micronutrients deficiencies. To enhance the dietary nutrient quality, the current study used two largely grown varieties of finger millet, pearl millet, pigeonpea, and chickpea to evaluate the effect of millet–legume blends for their enhanced protein digestibility, amino acid profiles, and essential micronutrients. Findings Our study revealed the presence of significant levels of proteins (6.3%–22.3%), essential amino acids, and micronutrients (Fe: 2.6–8.5 mg; Zn: 2–5.5 mg; Ca: 22-450 mg in 100 g) in these varieties. When specific millets combined with legumes in 3:1 proportion, significantly enhanced nutritional value of food by providing a balanced amino acid with good protein digestibility, and high levels of iron (7.58 mg) and zinc (4.96 mg) with 100 g of pearl millet and calcium (400.57 mg) with 100 g of finger millet. Conclusions Pigeonpea and chickpea have a good level of proteins with essential amino acids except methionine and cysteine, whereas millet had balanced amino acid including methionine and cysteine (50% higher) and much higher levels of micronutrients (Fe, Zn and Ca). Therefore, specific millets and legumes combination complemented higher levels of micronutrients in addition to complete proteins to support comprehensive human nutrition. Significance and novelty This study opens prospects for selecting complementary nutrient-dense varieties for household consumption. Industries can explore these product developments significantly to reduce malnutrition if consumed adequately, which is not possible with polished rice, refined wheat flour or maize even if it is combined with legumes.",

However, pulses also contain bioactive compounds such as phytates, saponins, or polyphenols/tannins that can exhibit ambivalent nutritional properties depending on their amount in the diet. We characterized the nutritional composition and bioactive compound content of five types of prepared pulses frequently consumed in France (kidney beans, white beans, chickpeas, brown and green lentils, flageolets), and specifically compared the effects of household cooking vs. canning on the composition of pulses that can be consumed one way or the other. The contents in macro-, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds highly varied from one pulse to another (i.e., 6.9 to 9.7 g/100 g of cooked product for proteins, 4.6 to 818.9 µg/100 g for lutein or 15.0 to 284.3 mg/100 g for polyphenols). The preparation method was a key factor governing pulse final nutritional composition in hydrophilic compounds, depending on pulse species. Canning led to a greater decrease in proteins, total dietary fibers, magnesium or phytate contents compared to household cooking (i.e., −30%, −44%, −33% and −38%, p < 0.05, respectively, in kidney beans). As canned pulses are easy to use for consumers, additional research is needed to improve their transformation process to further optimize their nutritional quality.",

		"abstract": "Legumes are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which make them susceptible to (non) enzymatic oxidations leading to undesirable odour formation. This study aimed to characterise the volatile and fatty acid profiles of eleven types of legumes using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and GC coupled with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID), respectively. Volatile aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, esters, terpenes and hydrocarbons were the chemical groups identified across all the legumes. The lipids comprised palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and α-linolenic acids, with unsaturated fatty acids comprising at least 66.1% to 85.3% of the total lipids for the legumes studied. Multivariate data analysis was used to compare volatile and fatty acid profiles between legumes, which allow discriminant compounds pertinent to specific legumes to be identified. Results showed that soybean, chickpea and lentil had distinct volatile and fatty acid profiles, with discriminating volatiles including lactone, ester and ketone, respectively. While all three Phaseolus cultivars shared similar volatile profiles, 3-methyl-1-butanol was found to be the only volatile differentiating them against the other eight legumes. Overall, this is the first time a multivariate data analysis has been used to characterise the volatile and fatty acid profiles across different legume seeds, while also identifying discriminating compounds specific for certain legume species. Such information can contribute to the creation of legume-based ingredients with specific volatile characteristics while reducing undesirable odours, or potentially inform relevant breeding programs.",

		"abstract": "This years report should dispel any lingering doubts that the world is moving backwards in its efforts to end hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms. We are now only eight years away from 2030, but the distance to reach many of the SDG 2 targets is growing wider each year. There are indeed efforts to make progress towards SDG 2, yet they are proving insufficient in the face of a more challenging and uncertain context. The intensification of the major drivers behind recent food insecurity and malnutrition trends (i.e. conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks) combined with the high cost of nutritious foods and growing inequalities will continue to challenge food security and nutrition. This will be the case until agrifood systems are transformed, become more resilient and are delivering lower cost nutritious foods and affordable healthy diets for all, sustainably and inclusively.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries.\nMETHODS: We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories (<18·5 kg/m(2) [underweight], 18·5 kg/m(2) to <20 kg/m(2), 20 kg/m(2) to <25 kg/m(2), 25 kg/m(2) to <30 kg/m(2), 30 kg/m(2) to <35 kg/m(2), 35 kg/m(2) to <40 kg/m(2), ≥40 kg/m(2) [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue.\nFINDINGS: We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19·2 million adult participants (9·9 million men and 9·3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21·7 kg/m(2) (95% credible interval 21·3-22·1) in 1975 to 24·2 kg/m(2) (24·0-24·4) in 2014 in men, and from 22·1 kg/m(2) (21·7-22·5) in 1975 to 24·4 kg/m(2) (24·2-24·6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21·4 kg/m(2) in central Africa and south Asia to 29·2 kg/m(2) (28·6-29·8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21·8 kg/m(2) (21·4-22·3) in south Asia to 32·2 kg/m(2) (31·5-32·8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13·8% (10·5-17·4) to 8·8% (7·4-10·3) in men and from 14·6% (11·6-17·9) to 9·7% (8·3-11·1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight in 2014, 23·4% (17·8-29·2) in men and 24·0% (18·9-29·3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3·2% (2·4-4·1) in 1975 to 10·8% (9·7-12·0) in 2014 in men, and from 6·4% (5·1-7·8) to 14·9% (13·6-16·1) in women. 2·3% (2·0-2·7) of the world's men and 5·0% (4·4-5·6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI ≥35 kg/m(2)). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0·64% (0·46-0·86) in men and 1·6% (1·3-1·9) in women.\nINTERPRETATION: If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18% in men and surpass 21% in women; severe obesity will surpass 6% in men and 9% in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world's poorest regions, especially in south Asia.\nFUNDING: Wellcome Trust, Grand Challenges Canada.",

		"abstract": "In order to study seed and dry matter (DM) yield and relationships between yield and morphological traits, 10 populations of sainfoin (Onobrychis saliva), were assessed in two separate experiments under sward and spaced plant conditions using complete block design with two replications, in Karaj, Iran, during 2004-2007. The data were collected for seed yield, DM yield, plant height, stem number per m(2), flowering date, inflorescences length and 1000-grain weight. The data were analyzed for individual experiment and combined over two experiments. Results showed significant differences among populations for all of traits except 1000-grain weight in sward and DM yield and stem number in spaced plants. Results of combined analysis showed no significant differences among 2 conditions for both seed and DM yield. However, the average values of 7.3 and 6.2 ton ha(-1) DM yield and 337 and 375 kg ha(-1) seed yield were obtained for sward and spaced plants, respectively. Results showed that, populations of Shahrkord and Kashan with average values of 8.08 and 8.06 ton ha(-1) DM yield and Shahrkord with average values 551 kg ha(-1) seed yield had higher production under sward conditions. For spaced plants, Orumieh and Bijar with average values of 7.98 and 7.67 ton ha(-1) DM yield and Bijar and Esfahan with average values of 510 kg ha(-1) seed yield had higher production. Therefore, the populations of Shahrkord and Bijar were introduced as the best ones for both DM and seed production under swards and spaced plants, respectively. DM yield was positively correlated with seed yield, plant height, stem number and inflorescences length, while seed yield had positive and significant relationships with 1000-grain weight, plant height, stem number and inflorescences length. The relationship between spaced plants and swards as measured by phenotypic correlation was poor for all traits except 1000-grain weight. This suggests that response to selection based on spaced plant data would not be reflected in swards, so, for all characters selection should be based on sward yield.",

		"abstract": "Honey bees are the most important managed pollinator worldwide and are vital to the success of modern agriculture. Native, wild bees are also important pollinators in both natural and agricultural systems, and are highly sensitive to habitat in the surrounding landscape. Few studies, however, have considered how managed honey bees, and their effectiveness as crop pollinators, may be influenced by variation in the surrounding landscape. If honey bees are influenced by areas outside of the crop fields in which they are placed, their effectiveness as crop pollinators could be diminished. The goal of this study was to determine whether the relationship between honey bee hive density and crop yield varies with the composition of the surrounding landscape. We collected historical (2000–2011) data on yield and honey bee hive stocking density from 38 commercial cranberry growers in central Wisconsin. Using mixed-model regression analyses we found that cranberry yield was strongly, positively correlated with hive density but this effect diminished as the proportion of the surrounding landscape in woodland increased. Thus, at cranberry marshes in low-woodland landscapes (e.g., <42% woodland within 1km), increasing the density of honey bees increased yields by about1000kg/hive, while cranberry marshes in high woodland landscapes saw no effect of adding honey bees. These results suggest that honey bees, like wild bees, are influenced by non-crop areas in the surrounding landscape and that landscape context should be considered when making management recommendations for the use of honey bees for crop pollination.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop) is not only a high-quality legume forage, but also a nectar-producing plant. Therefore, the flower color of sainfoin is an important agronomic trait, but the factors affecting its flower phenotype are still unclear. To gain insights into the regulatory networks associated with metabolic pathways of coloration compounds (flavonoids or anthocyanins) and identify the key genes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, metabolome and transcriptome of WF and AF of sainfoin.\nRESULTS: Delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin derivatives were the main anthocyanin compounds in the AF of sainfoin. These substances were not detected in the WF of sainfoin. The transcriptomes of WF and AF in sainfoin at the S1 and S3 stages were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. Overall, 10,166 (4273 upregulated and 5893 downregulated) and 15,334 (8174 upregulated and 7160 downregulated) DEGs were identified in flowers at S1 and S3 stages, respectively (WF-VS-AF). KEGG pathway annotations showed that 6396 unigenes were annotated to 120 pathways and contained 866 DEGs at S1 stages, and 6396 unigenes were annotated to 131 pathways and included 1546 DEGs at the S3 stage. Nine DEGs belonging to the \"flavonoid biosynthesis\"and \"phenylpropanoid biosynthesis\" pathways involved in flower color formation were identified and verified by RT-qPCR analyses. Among these DEGs, 4CL3, FLS, ANS, CHS, DFR and CHI2 exhibited downregulated expression, and F3H exhibited upregulated expression in the WF compared to the AF, resulting in a decrease in anthocyanin synthesis and the formation of WF in sainfoin.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use transcriptome technology to study the mechanism of white flower formation in sainfoin. Our transcriptome data will be a great enrichment of the genetic information for sainfoin. In addition, the data presented herein will provide valuable molecular information for genetic breeding and provide insight into the future study of flower color polymorphisms in sainfoin.",

This study was carried out to evaluate phenotypic variation and nutritive value of 38 sainfoin accessions from 21 different countries. A field trial was established in 2014 using a randomized complete block design with four replications near Saskatoon, Canada, with data collected in 2015 and 2016. Analysis of variance revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences among sainfoin accessions for winter survival, dry‐matter (DM) yield, regrowth per seed yield plant, 1,000‐seed weight, plant height, growth rate, spring vigour, days to flower, stem number, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF). Dry‐matter yield of sainfoin accessions ranged from 74 to 239 g/plant, plant height ranged from 37 to 70 cm, winter survival ranged from 20% to 94%, and seed yield ranged from 5 to 64 g/plant. Sainfoin accessions from North America produced the highest DM yield. Dry‐matter yield was positively correlated with plant height (r = 0.82), stem number (r = 0.75), growth rate (r = 0.72), spring vigour (r = 0.43), regrowth (r = 0.30), 1,000‐seed weight (r = 0.29), NDF (r = 0.71) and ADF (r = 0.74). Dry‐matter yield was negatively correlated with days to flower (r = −0.57) and CP concentration (r = −0.62). Sainfoin accessions were grouped into three main groups according to their agro‐morphological traits and nutritive value. Several promising sainfoin accessions have been identified to select for high forage yield and high winter survival in the cold climatic zone of temperate grassland.",

		"abstract": "In intensive agricultural landscapes, decreased pollinator numbers have often been attributed to the loss of natural habitats. However, several studies show that certain mass ﬂowering crops, such as oilseed rape (OSR), can alter the pattern of pollinator abundance at a ﬁeld and landscape level. These studies have focused mainly on bees; information about the eﬀect of OSR crops on other taxa is missing. We evaluated the abundance of bees and other (non-bee) ﬂower visitors, and the fruit set of insect-pollinated target plants (Raphanus sativus and Onobrychis viciifolia) on the margins of OSR and cereal ﬁelds in landscapes with varying densities of non-cropped habitats (landscape structure). The presence of OSR crops and wildﬂower resources in ﬁeld margins had varying eﬀects on the abundance of bees and non-bee ﬂower visitors. Bee abundance was enhanced by OSR crops, but decreased in complex landscapes. On the other hand, the abundance of non-bee ﬂower visitors depended on the landscape structure, particularly on the location of cereal ﬁelds. Despite the numerous and diverse communities of pollinators attracted by OSR crops and wildﬂower resources, fruit set was enhanced only for generalist insectpollinated plant species, because competition processes for pollinators aﬀect specialist plant species. We conclude that the incorporation of OSR crops and maintenance of wildﬂower resources in agri-environmental schemes should be considered to improve the pollination services in agricultural landscapes highly dominated by cereal ﬁelds.",

		"abstract": "1 Although it is well established that different plant species vary considerably in the quality of pollinator rewards they offer, it is unclear how plant reproductive systems, in particular an obligate dependence on insects for pollination, might influence the evolution of pollinator rewards. Moreover, unlike the interaction between nectar reward and pollinator visitation, we have a limited understanding of the way in which pollen quality influences pollinator foraging behaviour. 2 We quantified the pollen protein and amino acid content for 23 NW European plant species. Pollen quality was compared with breeding system (facultative- vs. obligate insect-pollinated). A subset of 18 plants was sampled from a single habitat. For these we compared the proportion of pollen collection visits made by bumblebees with the quality of pollen offered. 3 We found a significant association between pollen quality and reproductive system; pollen of obligate insect-pollinated species contained higher protein content. We also found a significant relationship with pollinator use; plants most frequently visited by pollen-collecting bumblebees produced the highest-quality pollen. 4 We discuss how the close relationship between pollen quality and bumblebee attraction may have important benefits for plant reproductive success. However, we also show how the disruption of this mutualism can have detrimental consequences for plant and pollinator alike.",

		"abstract": "The density and efficiency of bumble bees, honey bees, and alfalfa leafcutter bees on sainfoin, Onobrychis viciaefolia Scop., grown in southern Alberta were studied. Six species of bees were identified as pollinators, with alfalfa leafcutter bees comprising 56% of the observations, honey bees 40%, and bumble bees 4%. The density of flowers over the season can be described as curvilinear. The mean number of flowers per raceme decreased significantly over the season. The rate of foraging by pollinator species from flower to flower varied and is described by multiple regression models. Julian date, hour of day, and flower density are the independent variables. More than 90% of the bees visited three or fewer flowers per raceme when 60% of the racemes had three or more flowers available for pollination. The bees foraged on sainfoin for about 12 h per day and average bee density increased significantly with the corresponding flower density. A theoretical approach used to predict the bee populations required to pollinate varying flower densities shows that the required population of bumble bees is about two-thirds that of honey bees or alfalfa leafcutter bees. The observed populations of pollinators did not correspond well with the derived values, probably because multiple visits per flower are required for fertilization., Les auteurs ont étudié la densité et l’efficacité des bourdons, des abeilles domestiques et des mégachiles de la luzerne sur le sainfoin, Onobrychis viciaefolia Scop., cultivé dans le sud de l’Alberta. Parmi les insectes pollinisateurs de cette culture, ils ont observé six espèces d’apidés dont les trois susmentionées, dans les proportions 4%, 40% et 56%. Au cours de la saison de végétation, la densité des fleurs varie suivant une courbe curvilinéaire, et le nombre moyen de fleurs par grappe diminue de façon significative. Le taux de butinage varie selon les espèces pollinisatrices et est représentée par des modèles de régression multiples. La date du calendrier julien, l’heure du jour et la densité des fleurs sont les variables indépendantes. Plus de 90% des apidés à l’étude ont visité trois fleurs ou moins par grappe lorsque 60% des grappes comptaient au moins trois fleurs prêtes à être pollinisées. Les espèces observées passaient environ 12 h chaque jour à butiner dans le sainfoin, et leur densité moyenne a augmenté de façon significative en fonction de la densité des fleurs. L’approche théorique utilisée pour prévoir le nombre de sujets de chaque espèce nécessaire pour polliniser différentes densités de fleurs révèle que la population de bourdons requise à cette fin n’équivaut qu’au deux tiers environ du nombre d’abeilles domestiques ou de mégachiles de la luzerne. Le nombre de pollinisateurs de chaque espèce observé ne concorde pas avec les valeurs obtenues, et cela probablement parce que plusieurs visites d’une même fleur sont nécessaires pour assurer la fécondation.",

		"abstract": "Lentil is an important source of plant-based protein, and the protein and amino acid contents have a significant influence on its nutritional quality and value. In this study, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) models were developed by partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict the crude protein and 18 amino acid contents of lentil seeds. The effects of sample status (whole and ground), type of spectrometer (PerkinElmer DA 7250 and FT 9700), and amino acid/protein correlation on model performance were analyzed and evaluated. The DA 7250 models and FT 9700 models of protein and 14 amino acids, except histidine, tyrosine, methionine and cysteine, showed good statistical results with coefficients of determination for calibration (R2C) higher than 0.652 and residual predictive deviation (RPD) values higher than 1.57. The DA 7250 models achieved similar accuracy for the determination of compositions in whole and ground samples. Two spectrometers had no significant difference (p > 0.05) for measurement in ground lentils. NIRS models could perform better for certain amino acids when they were highly correlated to protein. Overall, NIRS had a significant potential for rapid, accurate and simultaneous prediction of protein and most amino acid contents in lentils.",

		"abstract": "The last decade has witnessed dramatic changes in global food consumption patterns mainly because of population growth and economic development. Food substitutions for healthier eating, such as swapping regular servings of meat for protein-rich crops, is an emerging diet trend that may shape the future of food systems and the environment worldwide. To meet the erratic consumer demand in a rapidly changing world where resources become increasingly scarce due largely to anthropogenic activity, the need to develop crops that benefit both human health and the environment has become urgent. Legumes are often considered to be affordable plant-based sources of dietary proteins. Growing legumes provides significant benefits to cropping systems and the environment because of their natural ability to perform symbiotic nitrogen fixation, which enhances both soil fertility and water-use efficiency. In recent years, the focus in legume research has seen a transition from merely improving economically important species such as soybeans to increasingly turning attention to some promising underutilized species whose genetic resources hold the potential to address global challenges such as food security and climate change. Pulse crops have gained in popularity as an affordable source of food or feed; in fact, the United Nations designated 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, proclaiming their critical role in enhancing global food security. Given that many studies have been conducted on numerous underutilized pulse crops across the world, we provide a systematic review of the related literature to identify gaps and opportunities in pulse crop genetics research. We then discuss plausible strategies for developing and using pulse crops to strengthen food and nutrition security in the face of climate and anthropogenic changes.",

Sainfoin, a perennial crop containing condensed tannins (CTs), is gaining popularity in western Canada because of its benefits for cattle. Its CTs make the crop bloat-free for grazing cattle while improving protein digestibility and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The CT-containing fenugreek is also considered as a bloat-free annual forage legume that was developed to serve in short-term crop rotations in western Canada. These crops are known to provide health and nutritional benefits to cattle with their high protein content and other beneficial nutraceuticals such as crude fiber, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, steroid sapogenins, and galactomannans. Some of these nutraceuticals have the potential to benefit human health; however, such attributes have not been studied enough to harness the full potential of these legume crops in Canada. Recent research suggests that legumes are a healthy substitute for meat. However, metabolite analysis of sainfoin is mostly limited to proteins and CTs. The CTs reported in sainfoin are involved in reduction of blood pressure and detoxification and providing anticancer properties in humans. Recent studies on fenugreek have highlighted the beneficial nutraceuticals associated with human health but most of those claims are not backed by relevant clinical studies. In this article, we reviewed the nutritional quality attributes of sainfoin and fenugreek and assessed their potential as functional foods and nutraceuticals for animal and human health based on scientific evidence.",

		"abstract": "A deeper understanding of the phytochemical composition of perennial legumes is important for animal nutrition as well as for the development of pharmaceuticals. The present study is an assessment of perennial legumes including clovers (Trifolium pratense L. and T. medium L.), medics (Medicago sativa L. and M. lupulina L.), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) and milkvetches (Astragalus glycyphyllos L. and A. cicer L.) as potential sources of bioactive compounds. Whole aerial parts of plants at stem elongation and full-flowering stages as well as morphological parts of fully flowering plants (leaves, stems and flowers) were analysed for four isoflavones (biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, and genistein), coumestrol, condensed tannins and triterpene saponins. According to total concentration of the four isoflavones in plants, the species were ranked as follows: T. medium (23.2–28.7 mg g–1 DM) > T. pratense > A. glycyphyllos = A. cicer = O. viciifolia = M. sativa = M. lupulina (0.054–0.212 mg g–1 DM). Young plants were 1.2–5.6-fold richer in isoflavones than fully flowering plants. Quantifiable concentrations of coumestrol and saponins were found in the Medicago species and tannins in O. viciifolia. In general, leaves contained the highest concentrations of the phytochemicals. These findings suggest considerable potential to improve legume-based forage quality through appropriate exploitation of species- or cultivar-specific phytochemicals and manipulation of the content of phytochemicals by management of production including growth stage at harvest and selection of plant species.",

		"abstract": "A field experiment including 3 sainfoin cultivars (Makedonka, EG Norm, and the Sokobanja population) was set up in a seed production trial with the aim of determining adequate row spacing for seed and forage yield. The cultivars were sown at 3 different row spacings (20 cm, 50 cm, and 80 cm) and at a within-row spacing of 1 cm. Seed yield was determined over a 3-year period, whereas forage yield and quality were evaluated from the 2nd cut in the 2nd and 3rd years. Crop thinning through the years, distinct competitive ability of sainfoin, and a large impact of weather conditions induced significant differences in seed yield among years. All cultivars gave considerably higher yields at wider row spacings in the 2nd and 3rd years of the experiment. The cultivars responded differently to variable row spacings across years, which was due to differences in seed yield performance under different growing spaces and available moisture conditions. Owing to the low profitability of seed yield, in respect of both seed and forage yield, the use of wider row spacings (about 50 cm) for vigorous cultivars and narrower row spacing (below 50 cm) for less vigorous cultivars for seed yield may become feasible.",

The thousands of phytochemicals they contain are implicated in cellular-based mechanisms to promote antioxidant defense and reduce inflammation. While recommendations encourage the intake of fruits and vegetables, most people fall short of their target daily intake. Despite the need to increase plant-food consumption, there have been some concerns raised about whether they are beneficial because of the various ‘anti-nutrient’ compounds they contain. Some of these anti-nutrients that have been called into question included lectins, oxalates, goitrogens, phytoestrogens, phytates, and tannins. As a result, there may be select individuals with specific health conditions who elect to decrease their plant food intake despite potential benefits. The purpose of this narrative review is to examine the science of these ‘anti-nutrients’ and weigh the evidence of whether these compounds pose an actual health threat.",

Together, InsP6 acid and its salts are termed “phytate” and are potent inhibitors of iron and zinc absorption. Traditional food processing can reduce the InsP6 content through loss of water-soluble phytate or through phytase hydrolysis to lower myo-inositol phosphate forms that no longer inhibit iron and zinc absorption. Hence, some processing practices can reduce the need for high-dose iron fortificants in plant-based diets and alleviate safety concerns. Dietary phytate-to-iron and phytate-to-zinc molar ratios are used to estimate iron and zinc bioavailability and to identify dietary iron and zinc requirements according to diet type. The European Food Safety Authority has set adult dietary zinc requirements for 4 levels of phytate intake, highlighting the urgent need for phytate food composition data. Such data will improve the ability to estimate the prevalence of inadequate zinc intakes in vulnerable groups in LICs, which will facilitate implementation of targeted policies to alleviate zinc deficiency.",

Findings For both peas and lentils, main effects of G and/or E were observed for most of the flour and bread parameters including sensory properties. Significant GxE effects were also observed for some of the flour and bread parameters. Conclusions Both G and E influenced the flour and bread baking properties of peas and lentils. To ensure consistent flour quality and to meet flour specifications, G and E should be considered when sourcing peas and lentils for flour production. Significance and novelty The findings from this research greatly advance our understanding of the importance of G and E on the quality of pea and lentil flours and their baking performance.",

		"abstract": "Pea is one of the most produced and consumed pulse crops around the world. The study of genetic variability within pea germplasm is an important tool to identify outstanding accessions with optimal functional and nutritional qualities. In the present study, a collection of 105 pea accessions was analysed for physicochemical properties, pasting viscosity, and basic composition parameters. While pasting viscosities were negatively correlated to hydration capacity, cooking time, and basic composition, a positive correlation was found between the hydration capacity and the basic composition parameters. Basic composition (protein, fibre, fat, and resistant starch) parameters were further evaluated regarding seed trait morphology, namely, seed shape, colour, and surface. Allelic characterisation at the r and rb genetic loci was performed in a subgroup of 32 accessions (3 phenotyped as smooth and 29 as rough seeded), revealing that none of the initially classified rough-seeded accessions were rb mutants, 19 were r mutants, and 13 were neither r nor rb. Despite their initial phenotypic classification, the 13 accessions genetically classified as smooth behaved differently (p < 0.05) to the 19 r mutants in terms of physicochemical properties, pasting viscosity, and basic composition parameters. Using multivariate analysis of the most discriminatory parameters for the food-related traits studied, the best-performing accessions at functional and nutritional levels were identified for future plant breeding to improve field pea production and consumption.",

Optimum temperature range for germination of sainfoin was from l5 to 20 C. A higher range of optimum temperature, 20 to 30 C, was found for seedling growth. The presence of pods at all temperatures reduced speed of germination and speed of seedling elongation. Pods on the seed slowed water absorption by 4 to 5 hr. A water soluble inhibitor which slowed the speed of germination of shelled seed was detected. This inhibitor was readily removed from the pod by washing. Mechanical restriction of germination by the pod appeared to be a minor factor in the total effect of the pod on speed of germination. There was no difference in field emergence rates of sainfoin seedlings from shelled and unshelled seed.",

		"abstract": "Modern intensive monocropping system is becoming unproductive, pest ridden, loss incurring, and resource depleting and hence turning out to be untenable. Lack of discrimination in input use by farm managers and overall poor management are accelerating degradation and desertification processes, and loss of biodiversity particularly add in endangered regions. While, properly designed diverse and strategically located tree/seasonal crop based land use systems can contribute to ecologic services by mitigation land degradation, climate change and desertification, while conserving natural resources and biodiversity. Besides providing, diverse goods and services, on-farm diversity can be considered as an adoptive strategy in areas climatically and biologically vulnerable. Being a potential C sink, tree based land use systems can also mitigate negative impacts of CO2 emission. As green belt/bank these have an important role in maintaining air, water and soil quality in mining and industrial areas. The so-called cellulosic feedstocks can be grown on marginal land, enhance soil fertility by promoting the growth of various soil organisms, and provide a climate- friendly source of energy. There are plenty of underexploited but potential plant species which can find niche in the existing agroecosystems with substantial addition to total production while contributing sufficiently to ecological services. These needs to be identified and useful models are developed for specific situations.",

		"abstract": "Increasing crop diversity has been proposed to increase the sustainability of cropping systems. If producers are to adopt these systems, they should also be economically viable. In this study conducted near Mandan, North Dakota, four no-till cropping systems with varying levels of crop diversity were evaluated over a 12-yr period to quantify system effect on crop productivity, input use, production costs, and economic risks and returns. Cropping system treatments included a small grain–fallow rotation (SG–Fallow) and a continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation (Cont SW) as baseline low-diversity rotations, a small grain–winter wheat (T. aestivum L.)–sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) rotation (SG–WW–Sun), a 5-yr rotation (Five Year) and a dynamic rotation (Dynamic). The SG–Fallow rotation was significantly less productive and less profitable on average than the other rotations, as measured by gross returns and net returns, respectively. However, SG–Fallow also used significantly less inputs than the other rotations. Production costs for the Cont SW and SG–WW–Sun rotations showed a significant increasing trend over time, while production costs for the Five Year rotation showed a significantly lower and slight decreasing trend over the period, with cost trends for the SG–Fallow and Dynamic rotations intermediate to these. Net returns tended to increase and relative economic risk tended to decrease as crop diversity increased from SG–Fallow and Cont SW to SG–WW–Sun, Five Year and the Dynamic system. Results from this study suggest that more diverse rotations can maintain or increase crop productivity and enhance economic viability.",

		"abstract": "Cropping sequence diversification provides a systems approach to reduce yield variations and improve resilience to multiple environmental stresses. Yield advantages of more diverse crop rotations and their synergistic effects with reduced tillage are well documented, but few studies have quantified the impact of these management practices on yields and their stability when soil moisture is limiting or in excess. Using yield and weather data obtained from a 31-year long term rotation and tillage trial in Ontario, we tested whether crop rotation diversity is associated with greater yield stability when abnormal weather conditions occur. We used parametric and non-parametric approaches to quantify the impact of rotation diversity (monocrop, 2-crops, 3-crops without or with one or two legume cover crops) and tillage (conventional or reduced tillage) on yield probabilities and the benefits of crop diversity under different soil moisture and temperature scenarios. Although the magnitude of rotation benefits varied with crops, weather patterns and tillage, yield stability significantly increased when corn and soybean were integrated into more diverse rotations. Introducing small grains into short corn-soybean rotation was enough to provide substantial benefits on long-term soybean yields and their stability while the effects on corn were mostly associated with the temporal niche provided by small grains for underseeded red clover or alfalfa. Crop diversification strategies increased the probability of harnessing favorable growing conditions while decreasing the risk of crop failure. In hot and dry years, diversification of corn-soybean rotations and reduced tillage increased yield by 7% and 22% for corn and soybean respectively. Given the additional advantages associated with cropping system diversification, such a strategy provides a more comprehensive approach to lowering yield variability and improving the resilience of cropping systems to multiple environmental stresses. This could help to sustain future yield levels in challenging production environments.",

Women presented lower DDS compared to men (5.5 ± 1.1 vs. 5.6 ± 1.1, p < 0.001). Healthy DQS was higher as the socio-economic level increased, and unhealthy DQS was the opposite (p < 0.05). Total DQS was significantly lower only at the low socio-economic level (p < 0.05). Chile and Venezuela showed the lowest healthy (62.2 ± 15.2 and 61.9 ± 11.7, p < 0.05) and total DQS (61.4 ± 10.3, 61.2 ± 8.7, p < 0.05).

A household diet diversity score (DDS) and daily intake per adult equivalent of energy, protein, iron, vitamin A, and zinc were calculated from 7-d household consumption data. CSR was calculated from plot-level data on all crops cultivated during the 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 agricultural seasons in Malawi. Adjusted generalized estimating equations were used to assess the longitudinal relation of CSR with household diet quality and diversity.\nRESULTS: CSR was positively associated with DDS (β: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12; P < 0.001), as well as daily intake per adult equivalent of energy (kilocalories) (β: 41.6; 95% CI: 20.9, 62.2; P < 0.001), protein (grams) (β: 1.78; 95% CI: 0.80, 2.75; P < 0.001), iron (milligrams) (β: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.44; P < 0.001), vitamin A (micrograms of retinol activity equivalent) (β: 25.8; 95% CI: 12.7, 38.9; P < 0.001), and zinc (milligrams) (β: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.38; P < 0.001). Neither proportion of harvest sold nor distance to nearest population center modified the relation between CSR and household diet diversity or quality (P ≥ 0.05). Households with greater CSR were more commercially oriented (least-squares mean proportion of harvest sold ± SE, highest tertile of CSR: 17.1 ± 0.52; lowest tertile of CSR: 8.92 ± 1.09) (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Promoting on-farm CSR may be a beneficial strategy for simultaneously supporting enhanced diet quality and diversity while also creating opportunities for smallholder farmers to engage with markets in subsistence agricultural contexts.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship(s) between overall and within-food group diversity and several indices of dietary quality, such as dietary adequacy, moderation and balance, in Belgian adults. Dietary quality indices were derived from the food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG).\nDESIGN: Information on food intake was collected with two 24 h recalls.\nSETTING: Average overall and within-food group diversity scores and dietary adequacy, moderation and balance scores were calculated.\nSUBJECTS: A representative sample (n 3245) of the Belgian population at the age of 15 years and older was randomly selected from the National Register using a multistage stratified procedure.\nRESULTS: For both men and women, total dietary diversity score increased with age and smokers had a significantly lower overall diversity score than non- or former smokers. A positive association was found between overall dietary diversity and both dietary adequacy and balance. For most food groups, especially bread and cereals, vegetables, dairy products and spreadable fats, within-food group dietary diversity was positively associated with the fulfillment of the specific recommendation for the intake of that food group. An inverse association was found between dietary diversity within the meat and the energy-dense, nutrient-poor food groups and dietary balance. Diversity within the dairy and spreadable fat group was responsible for the strongest increase in overall dietary adequacy and balance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall dietary diversity is a useful indicator of dietary quality in Belgium. For some food groups, within-food group dietary diversity is a useful indicator of compliance with the specific FBDG for intake of that food group.",

		"abstract": "Crop diversification would improve the sustainability of Western agricultural production systems, yet few farmers have adopted this approach. This chapter presents an economic analysis of the main lock-in effects explaining why cropping diversity has not become widespread. Technological lock-in has resulted from the coevolution of crop systems (based on the post-WWII agrochemical paradigm), public policies, and market dynamics that promote major crops such as cereals. This chapter explains how interrelated factors have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of minor crops. The evolutionary economics approach used here identifies the main economic mechanisms that reinforce the choice of an initial production pathway. Today with the development of the bio-economy, we also examine whether new technological pathways in the agro-food sector may be able to reverse this lock-in.",

		"abstract": "Agricultural specialization is a complex multidimensional process, with multiple drivers and consequences. In this chapter specialization—focusing largely on an “Eastern European/North American” perspective—is discussed in the context of the related notions of agricultural intensification and agricultural concentration. The primary drivers of agroecosystem specialization, including mechanization, economies of size and scale, technological innovations, comparative advantage, market forces and “productionist” agricultural policies are described. Next, agricultural specialization is related to farms and farmland characteristics, notions of efficiency, and the geographic scale of specialization. The relations between multiscalar specialization and multiscalar ecologic simplification are outlined. Finally the consequences of specialization are assessed in terms of their potential ecologic and economic impacts on four key agroecosystem system properties: productivity, stability, persistence, and justice.",

		"abstract": "Twenty-first-century challenges for food and nutrition security include the spread of obesity worldwide and persistent undernutrition in vulnerable populations, along with continued micronutrient deficiencies. Climate change, increasing incomes and evolving diets complicate the search for sustainable solutions. Projecting to the year 2050, we explore future macronutrient and micronutrient adequacy with combined biophysical and socioeconomic scenarios that are country-specific. In all scenarios for 2050, the average benefits of widely shared economic growth, if achieved, are much greater than the modelled negative effects of climate change. Average macronutrient availability in 2050 at the country level appears adequate in all but the poorest countries. Many regions, however, will continue to have critical micronutrient inadequacies. Climate change alters micronutrient availability in some regions more than others. These findings indicate that the greatest food security challenge in 2050 will be providing nutritious diets rather than adequate calories. Research priorities and policies should emphasize nutritional quality by increasing availability and affordability of nutrient-dense foods and improving dietary diversity.",

The phytochemical properties of the sainfoin extract were determined presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, peptide/proteins, sugars, amino acids, phenols and phenolic acid, choline and flavonoids. Sixty female and 60 male of total 120 numbers of wistar albino mice, 25-35g weight, approximately two months age were used to determine acute LD50 level of the sainfoin extract. Acute oral LD50 of sainfoin was found ≥19000 mg/kg for males and ≥20000 mg/kg for females and phytochemical analysis of the extract or plant showed the presence of tannins, amino acids, proteins, sucrose, phenolic contents; but the presence of alkaloids, simple sugars, saponins and choline were not observed. We concluded that the acute toxicity of the plant orally administered to mice was low, which suggested that animal can consume safely it.",

		"abstract": "Grain crops are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a third of the consumed calories. Throughout human history, annual grain crops with high yields have been obtained through domestication. However, the “annual” characteristic brings associated a series of economic and environmental disadvantages, such as soil erosion or low soil resources use, that can be solved if the agriculture of annual varieties evolves towards perenniality. For this reason, there are numerous research groups dedicated to study and obtain perennial varieties of the most cultivated grain crops. In this review article, we have summarized the most important advances related to the subject, focusing on the domestication and hybridization of the most productive grains globally: wheat, rice, maize, rye and sorghum. We highlight their benefits for sustainable agriculture worldwide due to perennial grains may contribute to reducing erosion, acting avoiding carbon losses, reducing nutrient losses to waters or capturing nutrients deeper in soil when they are scarce, reducing farm costs and thus, increasing the effectiveness of agricultural grain crops. Despite perennial grain crops having disadvantages, they possess outstanding characteristics which make them resilient crops to deal with the imminent climate change. However, maintaining the perenniality trait without reducing genetic biodiversity is a great challenge of current scientific importance that must be deeply considered.",

		"abstract": "Perennial grain has been proposed to provide an effective means of ensuring both food and ecological security. The newly released cultivar of perennial rice 23 (PR23) represents a new rice production system that is based on no-tillage. Nevertheless, how perennial rice responds to this new system remains unclear. Two field experiments were conducted over four successive seasons from 2016 to 2017 in Jinghong, Yunnan Province, Southern China. Field experiment 1 showed perennial rice is an economically viable and environmentally safe cropping system compared to annual rice, and could obtain a stable and sustainable grain yield economically for successive seasons across years. In the perennial rice cropping system, N fertilizer had some negative effects on the regrowth of perennial rice. Field experiment 2 with four N rates N0, N1, N2 and N3 with 0, 120, 180 and 240 kg N ha−1, respectively and three planting densities D1, D2 and D3 with 10, 16.7 and 22.6 plants m-2, respectively on perennial rice was conducted to assess and ameliorate these negative effects of N fertilizer on the regrowth of perennial rice. The results showed that: (1) the N2D3 treatment (180 kg N ha−1 integrated with 22.6 plants m−2) resulted in a stable and high grain yield across three successive regrowth seasons (6.93 t ha−1) and optimized yield components (panicle no. m-2, spikelet no. panicle−1, grain weight) and root activity (10.81 g h−1 m-2); (2) the regrowth of perennial rice 23 was significantly limited by N fertilizer (P<0.05), and the N0D2 treatment had the best regrowth ability (97.8 %) across the three regrowth seasons; (3) additionally, the N2D3 treatment had the best N net productivity (27 kg N kg−1), profit (79 CNY kg−1) and sustainable production capacity (0.59), and could obtain more economic profit in successive perennial rice production. Perennial rice was able to be sustainably and economically produced for successive regrowth seasons across years, and the N2D3 treatment provided optimal conditions, which enhanced the regrowth rate, N productivity, economic benefit and yield potential. The use of less chemical N fertilizer and a higher planting density could enhance the sustainability of the grain yield and reduce fertilizer loss via a novel crop management scheme for perennial rice.",

It can provide multiple ecosystem services essential for sustainable production more effectively than production systems based on annual crops, such as protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon below ground, and building better pest tolerance.

		"abstract": "Perennial grain crops have been proposed as a transformative approach to agriculture. Replacing annual staple crops with perennialized growth types of the same crops could provide environmental services, improve labour efficiency and weather resilience, reduce seed costs and produce livestock fodder or fuelwood production. Yet, the technologies and science for agricultural development in Africa have focused almost exclusively on annuals. In this paper, we review the literature to explore what has been potentially overlooked, including missed opportunities as well as the disadvantages associated with perennial grains. The case studies of pigeon pea and sorghum are considered, as an analogue for perennial grain crops in Africa. We find that a substantial number of farmers persist in ‘perennializing’ pigeon pea systems through ratoon management, and that sorghum ratoons are widely practiced in some regions. In contrast, many crop scientists are not interested in perennial traits or ratoon management, citing the potential of perennials to harbour disease, and modest yield potential. Indeed, an overriding prioritization of high grain yield response to fertilizer, and not including accessory products such as fodder or soil fertility, has led to multipurpose, perennial life forms being overlooked. Agronomists are encouraged to consider a wide range of indicators of performance for a sustainable approach to agriculture, one that includes management for diversity in crop growth habits.",

The present study was thus developed to evaluate repeated measures over time in Jatropha curcas and examine the applicability and efficiency of the harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values (HMRPGV) method in the selection of families for yield, stability, and adaptability, simultaneously. The work involved data from the evaluation of 730 individuals of 73 half-sib families, in a complete randomized block design, during six crop years, for the trait grain yield. Restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) procedure was performed to estimate the variance components and predict the genetic values. Ten crop years must be evaluated to obtain 80% of the maximum coefficient of determination and 90% accuracy in terms of genetic gain from selection. The efficiency of performing 10 measurements compared with the situation in which only one measurement is used was 67%. The HMRPGV method has great potential in the selection of Jatropha curcas families for yield, stability, and adaptability, simultaneously.",

		"abstract": "Bloat of ruminant animals feeding on fresh, green alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is caused by high levels of soluble plant proteins which act as foaming agents. It is postulated that bloat-safe cultivars may be bred by introducing condensed tannins (flavolans) which would act as protein precipitants to preclude foam formation and consequent bloat. Using the vanillin-HCl spot test, large populations of alfalfa were screened for tannins. These included several accessions, cultivars, and breeding populations. Extensive screening of 2n M. falcata L. and 4n M. sativa treated with the chemical mutagens ethyl methanesulfonate or ethyleneimine failed to reveal any mutations for tannins. Screening of 33 species (a total of 86 accessions) of annual Medicago was negative. Similarly, screening of 28 species (a total of 92 accessions) of perennial Medicago was also negative. Examination of 30 species (46 accessions) of the closely related Trigonella genus did not reveal any tannin-containing plants. On the other hand, testing of 123 accessions of 10 species of Sainfoin (Onobrychis) showed that all plants examined within this bloat-safe genus contained high levels of tannins. Several of the common pasture legumes, including both bloat-causing and bloat-safe types, were examined for tannins in leaf tissue, flower (petal) tissue and seeds. All of these legumes except alfalfa and cicer milkvetch (Astragalus cicer I.,) contained tannins in petal tissue. All of the legumes, including alfalfa, contained tannins in seedcoat tissue except that of a homozygous recessive, white-seeded strain of alfalfa. The implications of breeding for tannins to provide a bloat-safe alfalfa are discussed.",

Sainfoin (O~zobrychisviciifolia Scop.) organs and tissues were surveyed for the presence of proanthocyanidins or condensed tannin (CT) in an attempt to learn more about CT formation. Three histological methods were used: a vanillin-HCI stain to localize areas of CT formation through a distinctive cherry-red coloration of CT-containing cells; osmium fixation to further localize CT formation in cellular organelles using light n~icroscopy;and fine localization and examination using electron microscopy. Cells containing CTs were found in relatively large numbers throughout the sainfoin plant in all organs except the roots. No CTs were found in the cotyledons or in some petals. Ultrastructural studies revealed that CTs are restricted to the vacuoles and appear to accumulate on the inner periphery adjacent to the tonoplast or in the centre of the organelle, possibly next to vacuolar invaginations.",

All the samples were reduced to a fine meal before being submitted to test in the digestion trials.\n            Apart from its lower content of digestible ether extract, ryegrass-seed meal resembles oats in respect of chemical composition, digestibility and starch equivalent. It is a carbohydrate concentrate, containing, on the dry matter basis, 69·4% of starch equivalent, including 7·3% of digestible protein.",

		"abstract": "Agronomic and seed-quality traits in 17 quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) accessions grouped according to seed colour (i.e. ochre and yellow) were investigated and compared with the white commercial cultivar Regalona-Baer. These accessions were previously selected from a range of accessions of diverse origin and seed colour for their potential value in a breeding program for cultivars adapted to the southern Italian environment. Field trials were conducted over 2 years in Foggia, southern Italy. The aim was to identify elite genotypes suited to the Mediterranean Basin in terms of high yields and seed quality, by using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. The genotype and year effects were statistically significant for most parameters investigated, whereas the genotype × year interaction was significant only for seed quality. There were significant differences between the two seed-colour groups for most of the investigated traits, but not for total dry weight, days to flowering, and soluble and insoluble fibre. The major difference between the accessions and cv. Regalona-Baer was lower seed yield for the ochre seed group (30% lower, on average); this was associated with increased plant height (13% higher, on average), greater number of days to maturity (+6 days, on average) and shorter panicle length (21% shorter, on average). These results were observed for both growing seasons. The seed yield of the yellow seed group was similar to Regalona-Baer. Focusing on individual accessions, PCA indicated that accessions Q12, Q18 and Q26 were similar to Regalona-Baer for seed yield, 1000-seed weight, seed area and seed perimeter, and accession Q4 had the highest protein and kaempferol contents for both years. Seed area and perimeter, harvest index, and 1000-seed weight showed positive associations with seed yield, whereas days to flowering, days to maturity and quality traits were negatively correlated with seed yield for both years. Cluster analysis carried out on all of the agronomic and seed-quality traits did not show clear clustering of the accessions based on seed colour alone. The results of this study confirm that both the ochre and yellow quinoa seed groups included elite accessions that can be used directly in future selection programs for the development of high-yielding varieties well adapted to the Mediterranean environment.",

		"abstract": "The goal of sustainable intensification of agriculture in Malawi has led to the evaluation of innovative, regionally novel or under-utilized crop species. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has the potential to provide a drought tolerant, nutritious alternative to maize. We evaluated 11 diverse varieties of quinoa for their yield and agronomic performance at two locations, Bunda and Bembeke, in Malawi. The varieties originated from Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia in South America; the United States and Canada in North America; and, Denmark in Europe, and were chosen based on their variation in morphological and agronomic traits, and their potential for adaptation to the climate of Malawi. Plant height, panicle length, days to maturity, harvest index, and seed yield were recorded for each variety under irrigation at Bunda and Bembeke, and under rainfed conditions at Bunda. Plant height was significantly influenced by both genotype and environment. There were also significant differences between the two locations for panicle length whereas genotype and genotype × environment (G × E) interaction were not significantly different. Differences were found for genotype and G × E interaction for harvest index. Notably, differences for genotype, environment and G × E were found for grain yield. Seed yield was higher at Bunda (237–3019 kg/ha) than Bembeke (62–692 kg/ha) under irrigated conditions. The highest yielding genotype at Bunda was Titicaca (3019 kg/ha) whereas Multi-Hued was the highest (692 kg/ha) at Bembeke. Strong positive correlations between seed yield and (1) plant height (r = 0.74), (2) days to maturity (r = 0.76), and (3) biomass (r = 0.87) were found under irrigated conditions. The rainfed evaluations at Bunda revealed significant differences in seed yield, plant biomass, and seed size among the genotypes. The highest yielding genotype was Black Seeded (2050 kg/ha) followed by Multi-Hued (1603 kg/ha) and Bio-Bio (1446 kg/ha). Ecuadorian (257 kg/ha) was the lowest yielding genotype. In general the seed yields of the genotypes were lower under rainfed conditions than under irrigated conditions at Bunda. The results also highlight the need to continue evaluating a diverse number of cultivars to select for genotypes adapted to specific agro-ecological areas and across seasons in Malawi.",

Hundreds of varieties and experimental lines are currently either grown or in development in many countries around the world. There exists a lack of information about, and understanding of, the nutritional composition and processing characteristics of these varieties and their potential end-use applications. Twenty-eight quinoa varieties and experimental lines tested in the Washington State University breeding program were evaluated for their chemical composition and physicochemical characteristics. Both compositional and physicochemical analysis demonstrated wide variation in properties among the varieties. Analysis of flour swelling power, water absorption index, and differential scanning calorimetry further supported the differences hypothesized between varieties. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the varieties into four clusters. Principal component analysis was used to visually display the data on a biplot, representing most of the variance (>60%) in the set. These results reflect possible end uses in bread, cakes, and noodles for varieties exhibiting high viscosities.",

		"abstract": "Quinoa is becoming increasingly popular, with an expanding number of commercially available varieties. To compare the sensory properties of these quinoa varieties, a common sensory lexicon needs to be developed. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a lexicon of cooked quinoa and examine consumer acceptance of diverse varieties. A trained panel (n = 9) developed aroma, taste/flavor, texture, and color descriptors to describe the sensory properties of 21 quinoa varieties. In addition, texture of the cooked quinoa was determined using a texture analyzer. Results indicated that the developed lexicon could distinguish among these quinoa varieties, showing significant differences in aromas, taste/flavors, and texture attributes. Specifically, quinoa variety effects were observed for the aromas of caramel, nutty, buttery, grassy, earthy, and woody; taste/flavor of sweet, bitter, grain-like, nutty, earthy, and toasty; and firm, cohesive, pasty, adhesive, crunchy, chewy, astringent, and moist textures. Three varieties, \"QQ74,\" \"Linares,\" and \"CO407D,\" exhibited an adhesive texture that has not been described in other commercialized quinoa. Subsequent consumer evaluation (n = 100) on 6 selected samples found that the \"Commercial Red\" sample was the most accepted overall whereas the least accepted was the field variety \"QQ74.\" For all consumers, overall acceptance of quinoa was driven by higher intensities of grassy aroma, and firm and crunchy texture. Segmentation of the consumers into 4 groups was explored and showed that consumers varied in their acceptance of specific attributes, particularly texture. From the present study, the quinoa lexicon and key drivers of consumer acceptance can be utilized in the industry to evaluate quinoa varieties, product quality and processing procedures.",

		"abstract": "Starch characteristics significantly influence the functionality and end-use quality of cereals and pseudo-cereals. This study examined the composition and properties of starch from 11 pure varieties and 2 commercial samples of quinoa in relationship to the texture of cooked quinoa. Nearly all starch properties and characteristics differed among these samples. Results showed that total starch content of seeds ranged from 53.2 to 75.1 g/100 g apparent amylose content ranged from 2.7% to 16.9%; total amylose ranged from 4.7% to 17.3%; and the degree of amylose–lipid complex ranged from 3.4% to 43.3%. Amylose leaching ranged from 31 mg/100 g starch in “Japanese Strain” to 862 mg/100 g starch in “49ALC.” “Japanese Strain” starch also exhibited the highest water solubility (4.5%) and the lowest swelling power (17). α-Amylase activity in “1ESP,” “Col.#6197,” “Japanese Strain,” “QQ63,” “Yellow Commercial,” and “Red Commercial” (0.03 to 0.09 CU) were significantly lower than the levels of the other quinoa samples (0.20 to 1.16 CU). Additionally, gel texture, thermal properties, and pasting properties of quinoa starches were investigated. Lastly, correlation analysis showed that the quinoa samples with higher amylose content tended to yield harder, stickier, more cohesive, more gummy, and more chewy texture after cooking. A higher degree of amylose–lipid complex and amylose leaching were associated with softer and less chewy cooked quinoa TPA texture. Higher starch enthalpy correlated with firmer, more adhesive, more cohesive, and chewier texture. In sum, starch plays a significant role in the texture of cooked quinoa. Practical Application The research determined starch characteristics among a diverse set of pure quinoa varieties and commercial samples, and identified the relationships between starch properties and cooked quinoa texture. The results can help breeders and food manufacturers to understand better the relationships among quinoa starch characteristics, cooked quinoa texture, and the best use of different cultivars.",

		"abstract": "Chenopodium quinoa Willd (quinoa) has acquired an increased agronomical and nutritional relevance due to the capacity of adaptation to different environments and the exceptional nutritional properties of their seeds. These include high mineral and protein contents, a balanced amino acid composition, an elevated antioxidant capacity related to the high phenol content, and the absence of gluten. Although it is known that these properties can be determined by the environment, limited efforts have been made to determine the exact changes occurring at a nutritional level under changing environmental conditions in this crop. To shed light on this, this study aimed at characterizing variations in nutritional-related parameters associated with the year of cultivation and different genotypes. Various nutritional and physiological traits were analyzed in seeds of different quinoa cultivars grown in the field during three consecutive years. We found differences among cultivars for most of the nutritional parameters analyzed. It was observed that the year of cultivation was a determinant factor in every parameter studied, being 2018 the year with lower yields, germination rates, and antioxidant capacity, but higher seed weights and seed protein contents. Overall, this work will greatly contribute to increase our knowledge of the impact of the environment and genotype on the nutritional properties of quinoa seeds, especially in areas that share climatic conditions to Southern Europe.",

After minimum sample preparation amino acids were derivatized with two different reagents, o-phthalaldehyde-3-mercaptopropionic acid for primary and 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate for secondary amino acids, by an automated precolumn derivatization technique. With minor adjustments of separation parameters this method can also be used to determine amino acids in different matrices. Analysis time including reaction, separation and reconditioning ranged from 20 min for hydrolysates to 60 min for physiological fluids. The separation was done on a reversed-phase column with a gradient of acetate buffer-acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The precision for peak areas of the individual amino acids was within a relative standard deviation of 2% for the hydrolysate assay and 2-5% for the physiological assay, and for retention times better than 0.7%. The detection limit with the diode array detector (ultraviolet-visible) was ca. 2-5 pmol, measured at 338 nm for primary and 266 nm for secondary amino acids; with the fluorescence detector 20-50 fmol were detectable at excitation and emission wavelengths of 230 and 455 nm for primary and 266 and 310 nm for secondary amino acids, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Quinoa seeds are highly nutritious due to the quality of their proteins and lipids and the wide range of minerals and vitamins they store. Three compartments can be distinguished within the mature seed: embryo, endosperm, and perisperm. The distribution of main storage reserves is clearly different in those areas: the embryo and endosperm store proteins, lipids, and minerals, and the perisperm stores starch. Tissues equivalent (but not homologous) to those found in grasses can be identified in quinoa, suggesting the effectiveness of this seed reserve distribution strategy; as in cells of grass starchy endosperm, the cells of the quinoa perisperm endoreduplicate, increase in size, synthesize starch, and die during development. In addition, both systems present an extra-embryonic tissue that stores proteins, lipids and minerals: in gramineae, the aleurone layer(s) of the endosperm; in quinoa, the micropylar endosperm; in both cases, the tissues are living. Moreover, the quinoa micropylar endosperm and the coleorhiza in grasses play similar roles, protecting the root in the quiescent seed and controlling dormancy during germination. This investigation is just the beginning of a broader and comparative study of the development of quinoa and grass seeds. Several questions arise from this study, such as: how are synthesis and activation of seed proteins and enzymes regulated during development and germination, what are the genes involved in these processes, and lastly, what is the genetic foundation justifying the analogy to grasses.",

		"abstract": "Quinoa is a crop originating in the Andes but grown more widely and with the genetic potential for significant further expansion. Due to the phenotypic plasticity of quinoa, varieties need to be assessed across years and multiple locations. To improve comparability among field trials across the globe and to facilitate collaborations, components of the trials need to be kept consistent, including the type and methods of data collected. Here, an internationally open-access framework for phenotyping a wide range of quinoa features is proposed to facilitate the systematic agronomic, physiological and genetic characterization of quinoa for crop adaptation and improvement. Mature plant phenotyping is a central aspect of this paper, including detailed descriptions and the provision of phenotyping cards to facilitate consistency in data collection. High-throughput methods for multi-temporal phenotyping based on remote sensing technologies are described. Tools for higher-throughput post-harvest phenotyping of seeds are presented. A guideline for approaching quinoa field trials including the collection of environmental data and designing layouts with statistical robustness is suggested. To move towards developing resources for quinoa in line with major cereal crops, a database was created. The Quinoa Germinate Platform will serve as a central repository of data for quinoa researchers globally.",

		"abstract": "The diet of approximately three billion people worldwide is nutrient deficient and most of the world's poorest people are dependent on staple food crops as their primary source of micronutrients. One component of the solution to nutrient deficiencies is collaboration among plant breeders, cereal chemists and nutritionists to produce staple crop cultivars with increased mineral nutrient concentration. Sixty-three historical and modern wheat cultivars were evaluated for grain yield and concentration of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc. While grain yield has increased over time, the concentrations of all minerals except calcium have decreased. Thus a greater consumption of whole wheat bread from modern cultivars is required to achieve the same percentage of recommended dietary allowance levels contributed by most of the older cultivars. The decrease in mineral concentration over the past 120 years occurs primarily in the soft white wheat market class, whereas in the hard red market class it has remained largely constant over time. This suggests that plant breeders, through intentional selection of low ash content in soft white wheat cultivars, have contributed to the decreased mineral nutrient concentration in modern wheat cultivars. These results contradict the theory that there exists a genetically based, biological trade-off between yield and mineral concentrations. Therefore, using the abundant variation present in wheat cultivars, it should be possible to improve mineral concentrations in modern cultivars without negatively affecting yield.",

		"abstract": "Rapid urbanization and nutrition transition result in increased energy-dense diets, characterized by high levels of refined sugars, salt, and other additives, increased saturated fat intake (mainly from animal source foods), and reduced intakes of complex carbohydrates, fiber, fruits, and vegetables. Most attention on healthy eating is focused on fats and lipids. Lipids are a heterogeneous group of compounds, including fats, oils, steroids, waxes, and related compounds. They are concentrated sources of energy as well as structural components of cell membranes. In addition, dietary fats have crucial physiological functions. The general recommendation is to replace dietary saturated fatty acid and trans-fat acids with polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega3 fatty acids. This approach reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain types of cancers. There is therefore a need to refine and update the manufacturing processes to ensure safe, healthier, and environmentally friendly fats and oils. Ultimately, this will result in the changing of consumer perception of fats and oils and improve availability and consumption of these healthy fats and oils. Therefore, this chapter discusses the significance of health-related fatty acids, socio-economic aspects governing their presence in food and consumption, and how all these factors have a bearing on achieving the goal of human health, well-being as well as food and nutrition security.",

Excessive amounts of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a very high omega-6/omega-3 ratio, as is found in today's Western diets, promote the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, whereas increased levels of omega-3 PUFA (a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio), exert suppressive effects. In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a ratio of 4/1 was associated with a 70% decrease in total mortality. A ratio of 2.5/1 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer, whereas a ratio of 4/1 with the same amount of omega-3 PUFA had no effect. The lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio in women with breast cancer was associated with decreased risk. A ratio of 2-3/1 suppressed inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and a ratio of 5/1 had a beneficial effect on patients with asthma, whereas a ratio of 10/1 had adverse consequences. These studies indicate that the optimal ratio may vary with the disease under consideration. This is consistent with the fact that chronic diseases are multigenic and multifactorial. Therefore, it is quite possible that the therapeutic dose of omega-3 fatty acids will depend on the degree of severity of disease resulting from the genetic predisposition. A lower ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids is more desirable in reducing the risk of many of the chronic diseases of high prevalence in Western societies, as well as in the developing countries, that are being exported to the rest of the world",

		"abstract": "Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n−3 and n−6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100–150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n−6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n−6 to n−3 fatty acids ranges from ≈20–30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1–2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n−6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n−3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n−3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, α-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.",

		"abstract": "There is growing awareness that the profound changes in the environment (eg, in diet and other lifestyle conditions) that began with the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry ≈10000 y ago occurred too recently on an evolutionary time scale for the human genome to adjust. In conjunction with this discordance between our ancient, genetically determined biology and the nutritional, cultural, and activity patterns of contemporary Western populations, many of the so-called diseases of civilization have emerged. In particular, food staples and food-processing procedures introduced during the Neolithic and Industrial Periods have fundamentally altered 7 crucial nutritional characteristics of ancestral hominin diets: 1) glycemic load, 2) fatty acid composition, 3) macronutrient composition, 4) micronutrient density, 5) acid-base balance, 6) sodium-potassium ratio, and 7) fiber content. The evolutionary collision of our ancient genome with the nutritional qualities of recently introduced foods may underlie many of the chronic diseases of Western civilization.",

		"abstract": "Omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (e.g., arachidonic acid (AA)) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA (e.g., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) are precursors to potent lipid mediator signalling molecules, termed “eicosanoids,” which have important roles in the regulation of inflammation. In general, eicosanoids derived from n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory while eicosanoids derived from n-3 PUFA are anti-inflammatory. Dietary changes over the past few decades in the intake of n-6 and n-3 PUFA show striking increases in the (n-6) to (n-3) ratio (~15 : 1), which are associated with greater metabolism of the n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA. Coinciding with this increase in the ratio of (n-6) : (n-3) PUFA are increases in chronic inflammatory diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). By increasing the ratio of (n-3) : (n-6) PUFA in the Western diet, reductions may be achieved in the incidence of these chronic inflammatory diseases.",

First studies on several genotypes have shown that this oil contains varying amounts of eriuc acid. The aim of the study was to analyses content of eriuc acid in all genotypes camelina. Hypothesis was that the content of erucic acid in winter forms is lower than in spring ones. A field experiment with 65 spring genotypes and 9 winter genotypes of camelina was conducted in Poland from 2016 to 2018. The analyses based on two chromatographic methods, i.e. UPLC-DAD and GC–MS, showed no differences in the results for the camelina samples. The average percentage content of the erucic acid in the spring genotypes was 3.432%, and in the winter genotypes was 0.1%. Our three-year research shows that some winter varieties can be used as low erucic acid forms.",

It is of utmost importance that the neglected and underutilized legumes (NULs) are identified and utilized as source of germane genes and gene-products, through concerted research platforms. In the present article, we analyzed the current status of NULs with specific emphasis to the potent utility of grasspea owing to its unique characters including stress adaptation, nutritional superiority and ease of cultivation. We have highlighted the landmarks in the history of grasspea, delineating the rapid progress achieved in grasspea biology during the past decades. Despite possession of a neurotoxic compound, β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), this neglected legume outshines most food crops with its distinct physicochemical attributes, health and agricultural benefits and resilience to environmental constraints. With the availability of genome sequence, grasspea is now established as an appropriate genetic resource for sustainable agriculture and phytoremediation rendering its genes, proteins and metabolites for targeted genetic manipulation. We conclude that grasspea would serve as a resource for plant translational genomics (TG) research, particularly resilience of legumes to environmental challenges.",

		"abstract": "Mucuna is one of the green manure/cover crops introduced in Kenya as an alternative means of improving soil fertility. Despite the proven high potential to increase soil fertility, adoption by farmers is not certain unless multiple uses are identified. In order to enhance the food potential of Mucuna, a study was carried out to determine the effect of cooking immature and mature beans in water or locally available alkaline or acid medium and the effect of germination on the cooking time, nutritional composition and anti-nutritional factors. Cooking time for mature beans was reduced from 4.5 h for beans boiled in water to 1.4 h for beans boiled in Magadi soda, 1.2 h for maize cob ash, 1.8 h for bean stover ash and 2.5 h for citric acid. Boiling whole mature beans in Magadi solution reduced L-Dopa by 59.3% while boiling in maize cob ash, citric acid and bean stover ash solution reduced it by 58.1, 49.7 and 47.4%, respectively. Particle size reduction led to higher extraction of L-Dopa. Boiling in water or germination for 5 d combined with boiling reduced the L-Dopa by only 24.9 and 38.5% respectively. All the processing treatments tested significantly affected the proximate composition of the beans. When compared to raw beans, boiling in plain water caused higher increases in the protein content of both immature and mature beans than the other treatments. The alkaline treatments reduced the fibre and ash contents more than cooking in plain water. All treatments increased the carbohydrate content of the beans. Sensory evaluation revealed that while Mucuna beans cooked in alkaline additive were more palatable in taste and texture, beans cooked in acid were lighter in colour and more acceptable. Overall, the common beans were more palatable than Mucuna. Further product development research incorporating Mucuna processed beans into local dishes needs to be carried out to improve consumer acceptability.",

		"abstract": "The potential for underutilized crops (also known as minor, neglected or orphan crops) to improve food and nutrition security has been gaining prominence within the research community in recent years. This is due to their significance for diversified agricultural systems which is a necessary component of future agriculture to address food and nutritional security concerns posed by changing climate and a growing world population. Developing workable value chain systems for underutilized crop species, coupled with comparative trait studies with major crops, potentially allows us to identify suitable agricultural modalities for such species. Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea L. Verdc.), an underutilized leguminous species, is of interest for its reported high levels of drought tolerance in particular, which contributes to environmental resilience in semi-arid environments. Here, we present a synopsis of suitable strategies for the genetic improvement of Bambara groundnut as a guide to other underutilized crop species. Underutilized crops have often been adapted over thousands of years in particular regions by farmers and largely still exist as landraces with little or no genetic knowledge of key phenotypic traits. Breeding in these species is fundamentally different to breeding in major crops, where significant pedigree structures and history allow highly directed improvement. In this regard, deploying new integrated germplasm development approaches for variety development and genetic analysis, such as multi-parent advance generation inter-crosses (MAGIC), within breeding programmes of underutilized species will be important to be able to fully utilize such crops.",

		"abstract": "Staple crops face major challenges in the near future and a diversification away from over-reliance on staples will be important as part of the progress towards the goal of achieving security of food production. Underutilized or neglected crops species are often indigenous ancient crop species which are still used at some level within the local, national or even international communities, but have the potential to contribute further to the mix of food sources than they currently do. The most cost-effective and easily disseminated changes that can be made to a crop are changes to the genetics, as these are contained within the seed itself and, for many species, the seed is a pure breeding, self-replicating, resource. This article focuses on the potential of underutilized crops to contribute to food security and, in particular, whether genetics and breeding can overcome some of the constraints to the enhanced uptake of these species in the future. The focus here is on overview rather than detail and subsequent articles will examine the current evidence base.",

Analysis of variance indicated that legume type, treatment and their interactive effects were significant on these antinutrients. The raw soybean seed was found to contain the highest levels of lectins (692.8 HU/mg), phytic acid (22.91 mg/g), total oxalate (370.5 mg/100 g) and soluble oxalate (200.7 mg/100 g) among all investigated seeds. Relatively high contents of lectins were detected in beans (87.69–88.59 HU/mg) and other pulses ranging from 2.73–11.07 HU/mg. Phytic acid in Canadian pulses varied slightly from 8.55–22.85 mg/g. Total oxalates were variable, ranging from 244.7–294.0 mg/100 g in peas, 168.6–289.1 mg/100 g in lentils, 241.5–291.4 mg/100 g in fava beans, 92.2–214.0 mg/100 g in chickpeas and 98.86–117.0 mg/100 g in common beans. Approximately 24–72% of total oxalate appeared to be soluble in all investigated pulses. Soaking the seeds in distilled water significantly decreased the contents of lectins (0.11–5.18%), total oxalate (17.40–51.89%) and soluble oxalate (26.66–56.29%), but had no impact on phytic acid. The cooking process was found to be more effective in reducing levels of all the investigated antinutritional factors, except phytic acid in common beans and soybean.",

Phytic acid contents and IVPD values differed significantly among and within these species. Phytic acid content (mg/g) was the highest in soybean (36.4) followed by urd bean (13.7), pigeonpea (12.7), mung bean (12.0) chickpea (9.6). On an average, phytic acid constituted 78.2 percent of the total phosphorus content and this percentage figure was the highest in soybean and the lowest in mung bean. In vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of pigeonpea and chickpea genotypes varied from 60.4 to 74.4 percent and 65.3 to 79.4 percent, respectively. The IVPD values of genotypes of mung bean, urd bean and soybean ranged from 67.2 to 72.2 percent, 55.7 to 63.3 percent and 62.7 to 71.6 percent, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between phytic acid and IVPD of these genotypes. Phytic acid was significantly and positively correlated with protein but the magnitude of correlation was very low in chickpea and pigeonpea. Results indicate that the genotypes of pulses with low phytic acid content could be identified and used in breeding program to improve their nutritive value and utilization.",

The physicochemical and nutritional properties and antioxidant capacities of seed coats of six Australian sweet lupin cultivars grown at two locations were evaluated.

It has the potential to bind mineral micronutrients in food and reduce their bioavailability. This study analyzed the phytic acid concentration in seeds of 19 lentil ( Lens culinaris L.) genotypes grown at two locations for two years in Saskatchewan, Canada. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the levels of phytic acid in commercial lentil genotypes and (2) the impact of postharvest processing and (3) the effect of boiling on the stability of phytic aid in selected lentil genotypes. The phytic acid was analyzed by high-performance anion exchange separation followed by conductivity detection. The Saskatchewan-grown lentils were naturally low in phytic acid (phytic acid = 2.5-4.4 mg g(-1); phytic acid phosphorus = 0.7-1.2 mg g(-1)), with concentrations lower than those reported for low phytic acid mutants of corn, wheat, common bean, and soybean. Decortication prior to cooking further reduced total phytic acid by >50%. As lowering phytic acid intake can lead to increased mineral bioavailability, dietary inclusion of Canadian lentils may have significant benefits in regions with widespread micronutrient malnutrition.",

Cooking peas by two different methods resulted in 13% phytate reduction. Peas incubated 6.5 hr from 25 to 80°C yielded maximum phytate loss (25%) at 60°C due to phytase activated hydrolysis. Germination (10 d) decreased pea phytate 75% and increased phytase activity 12-fold. Semi-purified germinated pea phytase showed temperature optimum at 45°C, pH optimum of 5.2, 30% inhibition by 1 mM inorganic P, and substrate preference for pyrophosphate. Incubation of early germinated peas at optima pH and temperature is suggested for maximum phytate reduction.",

		"abstract": "Growing public concerns about health haves prompted the search for novel food sources. The study is focused on the seeds, sprouted seeds and microgreens of Trifolium pratense, T. medium, Medicago sativa, M. lupulina, Onobrychis viciifolia, Astragalus glycyphyllos and A. cicer species as a potential source of value-added food ingredientsr. The samples were analysed for nutritional (wet chemistry, standard methods) and mineral (atomic absorption spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectrophotometry) profiles, isoflavones (ultra-performance liquid with diode array detector –UPLC-DAD), coumestrol (UPLC-DAD), condensed tannins (CT) (vanillin-H2SO4 assay) and triterpene saponins (UPLC with triple-stage quadrupole MS). In our study, each species displayed high, but species-dependent nutritional, mineral and phytochemical value. All counterparts of legumes were mineral and protein rich. A. glycyphyllos samples, especially seeds, were abundant in iron. Trifolium spp. were found to be important sources of isoflavones, Medicago spp. of coumestrol and saponins, and O. viciifolia of CT. The protein and phytochemical contents increased and total carbohydrates decreased from seeds to microgreens.Our findings proved for the first time that seeds, sprouted seeds, and especially microgreens of small-seeded legumes are promising new sources of ingredients for fortification of staple foods with bioactive compounds, minerals and nutrients.",

Kokten (2019): Fatty acid and trace element compositions of the seeds of different Onobrychis viciifolia genotypes. - Genetika, Vol 51, No.2, 585-593. Seed oil contents, fatty acid compositions and mineral contents of twenty Onobrychis viciifolia genotypes (sainfoin) were investigated in this study. The fatty acid composition of O. viciifolia genotypes had different saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. For saturated fatty acids, O. viciifolia genotypes contained palmitic and stearic acids as the major component and contained small amount of myristic and arachidic acids. The major unsaturated fatty acids were identified as oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. Total saturated fatty acids contents varied between 10.50 and 14.28% and total unsaturated fatty acid contents varied between 85.72 and 89.50%. Co, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn were detected in crop seeds in different amounts. The proximate analysis indicated that seed Co contents varied between 13.53 and 114.83 ppm, Mn contents between 28.14 and 97.20 ppm, Fe contents between 113.7 and 277.7 ppm, Cu contents between 7.19 and 12.24 ppm, Ni contents between 1.14 and 19.73 ppm and Zn contents between 26.03 and 52.39 ppm, respectively. The result of this study suggest that further studies are obligatory to invigorate in terms of animal nutrition and phytochemicals of O. viciifolia.",
