To create a rough draft of the manuscript, download the .Rmd file (manuscriptDraft_moreSamples_git.Rmd) and have the .json bibliography file (sainfoin_A_moreSamples_git.json), .docx template file(StylesTemplate_git.docx), and the reference formatting .csl file (apa-6th-edition_git.csl) in the same working directory as the .Rmd file. 

This manuscript is part of a series. Once additional articles are published, data clean up and data analysis files used to produce the data files in this repository will be added. This will reduce redundancy.
